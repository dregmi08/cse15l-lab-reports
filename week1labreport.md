__Step 1__ : Looking up your CSE 15L account 
For this step, I went to the following link: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php
Instead of opting to change my password to something else, I used my canvas log in password since the password met the strength requirement. 

__Step 2__ : Installing VSCode
In order to login to your course-specific account using ieng6, you need to download VSCode and use the command line. For this particular step, I did 
not need to install the IDE since I had done that last quarter for CSE 11.

__Step 4__ : Opening the Terminal
Since I am using a Macbook, I did not need to install git for Windows. To remotely connect, first open a new terminal, which you can do by selecting "Terminal" -> New Terminal in the toolbar at the top of the screen if you're using a Mac. If not, you can also click towards the bottom of the VSCode screen and drag up.
