Step 4:

Logging into `ieng6`

For this step, I just typed out my username using `ssh`. Even though I typed out this command fully, I did not have to type out my password to log in, since I created a public `ssh` key for my account during lab. By doing this, I saved time that I would normally spend typing in my password.

Step 5:

Cloning my fork of the repository.

For this step, I knew that I had typed out `git clone https://github.com/dregmi08/lab7` when I was running these commands during lab. So, I searched for it by repeatedly pressing the `up` key on my laptop. When first searching for the command, I pressed `up` nine times. 

Keys Pressed initially: *<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>*
  
 However, since I had followed these steps before, the lab7 repository was already clone, so I used the command `rm -rf lab7` to first delete the directory and then searched for the `git clone` command again.
  
  Keys Pressed second time:
    -Searching for rm -rf: *<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>*
    -Searching for `git clone` a second time : *<up><up><enter>*

Step 6:
  Compiling and Running the files
  
  To access the `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` command, I had to press the `up` key eleven times. To access the 
  `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` command, I also had to go eleven up. 
  
  Searching for the compile and run commands: *<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>*
