__Lab Report 3__
---

The following lab report will focus on the different uses of the `grep` command

__First use:__ `grep -v` or ***"Inverse search"***

In this first example, I switched into the `written_2` directory and typed the command `grep -v "Lucayans" */*/*.txt`. The output was very long so the following two images only contain some of the total output.
