A Brief History
English sea captains also came to know the beautiful but deserted Bahamian islands during the 17th century. England’s first formal move was on 30 October 1629, when Charles I granted the Bahamas and a chunk of the American south to his Attorney General, Sir Robert Health. But nothing came of that, nor of a rival French move in 1633 when Cardinal Richelieu, the 17th-century French statesman, tried claiming the islands for France.
Colonization and Piracy
In 1648 a group of English Puritans from Bermuda, led by William Sayle, sailed to Bahamian waters and established the first permanent European settlement on the island they named Eleutheria (now Eleuthera) after the Greek word for freedom. The 70 colonists called themselves the Eleutherian Adventurers, but life was very difficult and the colony never flourished, though Sayle was long honored for the effort. In 1666 a smaller island (called Sayle’s island) with a fine harbor was settled by Bermudians and renamed New Providence. It was later to become known as Nassau, capital of the Bahamas.
In 1670 six Lords Proprietors of Carolina were granted the Bahama islands by Charles II, but for nearly 50 years their weak governors on New Providence either couldn’t or wouldn’t suppress the piracy raging through the archipelago. Then, in 1684, to avenge countless raids against their ships, the Spanish dispatched a powerful squadron from Cuba to attack Nassau. This sent the majority of the English settlers fleeing to Jamaica or Massachusetts, but didn’t have much effect on the pirates.
Most feared of the 1,000 or more swashbucklers operating from the New Providence lair was Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard. Today you can visit a tower east of Nassau named after him. Another two infamous pirates were women: Anne Bonney and Mary Read had exceptionally bloodthirsty reputations and are still celebrated in the Bahamas. The pirates raided anything on the sea, living totally lawless — and often not very lengthy — lives. Moreover, there was not always a clear distinction between pirates and privateers, the latter officially authorized by their governments to plunder enemy ships during time of war. Anarchy and confusion reigned throughout the area.
In 1718, shortly after the Bahamas became a crown colony, Captain Woodes Rogers, a renowned ex-privateer, was named the first royal governor. Arriving in Nassau with a powerful force and promising amnesty for surrender, he became a legend by cleaning out many of the pirates and establishing some order. This incident inspired the national motto Expulsis Piratis — Restituta Commercia (Pirates Expelled — Commerce Restored), which was retained until 1971.
A few years later Rogers quit the islands only to return for a second time in 1729 after a period of bankruptcy and debtor’s prison in England. Before he died in Nassau in 1732 he had summoned the Bahamas’ first official Assembly, composed of 16 elected members for New Providence and four each for Harbour Island and Eleuthera. At this time, in all the Bahamas there were only about 2,000 settlers.
New Providence knew some spells of prosperity in the mid-18th century as privateering resumed with England at war with Spain. The town of Nassau expanded, and improvements were made between 1760 and 1768 by another revered governor, William Shirley from Massachusetts.
The American Revolutionary War
When the 13 American colonies, enraged by the Stamp Tax, got into the war that eventually brought independence, the Bahamas somewhat reluctantly found itself on England’s side. But reluctance dissolved as profits from privateering once again flowed into Nassau. This time the plundered vessels were American, but not all the victories were won by the privateers. On 3 March 1776, a rebel squadron under Commodore Esek Hopkins arrived and occupied Nassau for two weeks, a bloodless undertaking that emptied the island’s forts of arms and other military supplies. A smaller and equally non-violent American operation against the town in January 1778 lasted less than three days.
As the colonies’ war effort picked up steam, both France and Spain weighed in against the British. In May 1782, New Providence surrendered to a large Spanish-American invasion fleet from Cuba and for the next year a Spanish governor ruled the Bahamas.
News traveled slowly in those days. The Treaty of Versailles in 1783 formally restored the Bahamas to the British, but actual liberation came through a famous escapade that would never have happened in the age of the telegraph. Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Deveaux, a loyalist from South Carolina, sailed from Florida with six ships, picked up men and fishing boats at Harbour Island and Eleuthera, and “invaded” Nassau. Though vastly outnumbered and outgunned, Deveaux employed elaborate ruses with his little boats to convince the Spanish defenders that his force was overpowering. The humiliating Spanish surrender is proudly recalled in Bahamian history, even though it was all unnecessary: the peace treaty had been signed the previous week.
Deveaux was the first of some 7,000 loyalists who, with slaves and the promise of land grants, came to the Bahamas from the southern American colonies in the wake of the English defeat in the Revolutionary War. This influx profoundly affected the islands. A number of prominent Bahamians today are the descendants of loyalists or their slaves. As a reward for his efforts, Deveaux was given acreage on both New Providence and Cat Island. Other loyalists set up cotton plantations on various islands, and slaves soon became the majority of the population.
Emancipation and Decline
In the 1780s well over 100 cotton plantations were founded and flourished around the Bahamas. Prosperity from the land finally seemed a possibility. But by the end of the century cotton had fallen victim to a devastating plague of chenille bugs and exhaustion of the weak soil. Most of the planters left the islands and depression returned, only partly relieved by “wrecking,” the freelance business of salvaging cargo from the ships forever running aground in the dangerous Bahamian waters. (Some ships were deliberately misguided by lights on shore; Nassau harbor did not have a proper lighthouse until 1816).
Nassau became a free port in 1787, sparking a surge in trading activity. Loyalists built a number of the attractive colonial-style homes and public buildings still standing today, and during the War of 1812, privateers enjoyed another profitable spell against American vessels.
Slavery in the Bahamas was not as widespread or as vicious as on many sugar islands in the Caribbean. Some slaves were voluntarily freed or sold their liberty by loyalist owners. After 1804, no slaves were imported into the Bahamas. By 1822, the first registration counted 10,808 slaves on the 17 inhabited islands or island clusters. After Parliament in London abolished slavery in 1833, there was a transitional apprenticeship period of 5 years before all slaves in the colony became fully free on 1 August 1838. This included a few thousand slaves from ships captured by the Royal Navy. They were housed in specially founded settlements on New Providence and the Out Islands.
Civil War Blockade Running
Over the centuries, trouble on the nearby American continent has often meant good news for the Bahamas. When Lincoln ordered a blockade of the southern states in 1861 after the outbreak of the Civil War, the Bahamas quickly boomed. Nassau harbor was busy with ships unloading Confederate cotton and tobacco and taking aboard arms, medicine, and manufactured goods, mainly from Europe, to be run back through the northern blockade. As the war went on, speedy and camouflaged contraband vessels were built to slip past the ever-increasing Federal patrols. Profits from blockade running were incredible, and Nassau went wild. But the extravagant parties and carefree spending stopped abruptly with the North’s victory in 1865. Late the following year an immense hurricane sent a tidal wave over Hog Island (today Paradise Island), smashing Nassau’s flimsy buildings and ruining crops. Other islands were also devastated. As the Bahamas sank back into economic doldrums, citizens turned to agriculture, fishing, or salt raking. The spread of lighthouses and decent navigational charts had crippled the old standby, the wrecking trade.
For a time a new fiber called sisal seemed promising. But Bahamian soil was too poor and Mexico grew a better plant. Neville Chamberlain, future British Prime Minister, took over his family’s sisal operation on Andros in the 1890s. It failed, the natives said, because of that island’s evil elves called chickcharnies, who cast a spell on the family for disturbing the land. Hopes were raised, and also fizzled, over Bahamian citrus and pineapple. Sponging, another vitally important industry at the end of the 19th century, also had setbacks. A hurricane in 1839 drowned some 300 sponge fishermen in the ‘mud’ off Andros, and a devastating fungus some 40 years later killed almost all the sponges.
The 20th Century
Desperate for work, perhaps 20 percent of the Bahamian population left to take construction jobs in Florida between the turn of the century and World War I. During that war hundreds of Bahamians saw active service with British forces. The islands suffered food shortages and a serious bank failure, but nothing more threatening militarily than rumors of German submarines offshore.

***Some output not shown***

In this second example, I used the command `grep -v "Italy" travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToItaly.txt`

Here is the output:

```
grep -v "Italy" travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToItaly.txt

        along the winding Gardesana Occidentale, which cuts through the cliffs
        of the west shore, is spectacular. The resort town of Gardone Riviera
        is much appreciated for its parks and botanical gardens and as a base
        for hikes back into the hills. Above the resort, in Gardone di Sopra,
        is a 20th-century “folly,” Il Vittoriale, the bizarre and disturbing
        hillside residence of Gabriele D’Annunzio — poet, adventurer, fascist.
        He died here in 1936: Melancholy gardens of dark laurel and cypresses
        lead up to a hilltop mausoleum of the writer’s sarcophagus flanked by
        those of his disciples. It overlooks the prow of a patrol boat that
        D’Annunzio commanded during WWI, the Puglia, hauled up the hillside as
        the crowning piece of his relics.
        Lake Como (Lago di Como)
        Embraced by green wooded escarpments and backed by
        snow-capped Alps, the lake favored by some of England’s most romantic
        19th-century poets — Words­worth, Shelley, and Byron — retains a
        certain wistful atmosphere for the leisure hours of the Milanese (it’s
        less than an hour from Milan by train or car). As at Garda, a mild
        climate nurtures luxuriant vegetation in the villa gardens and
        parks.
        The lake dramatically divides into two arms on either side
        of the pretty resort town of Bellagio, which juts out on a hilly
        promontory. Up on the heights above the town, the elegant 18th-century
        Villa Serbelloni stands in the middle of a beautiful park of rose
        trees, camelias, magnolias, and pomegranates. Now in the hands of the
        Rockefeller Foundation, its famous gardens can be visited by guided
        tour. Don’t confuse the Villa Serbelloni with the luxury lakefront
        hotel of the same name.
        The lake’s southwest arm is the most attractive for your
        excursions. From Lezzeno, take a boat cruise to see the colorful
        grottoes, and look for the waterfall at Nesso. Como itself is a large
        factory town famous for its centuries-old silk production, but it has a
        handsome Gothic-Renaissance cathedral crowned by a superb Baroque dome
        that was added in 1744 by Turin’s great architect, Filippo Juvarra. It
        stands next to the arcaded and half-timbered Broletto, 13th-century
        seat of municipal government.
        The western shores of the lake are lined with gracious
        villas nestling in perfumed gardens. At Cernobbio, the 16th-century
        Villa d’Este is now a landmark 5-star hotel, one of Europe’s most
        special. Come at least for tea or a stroll among the cypresses and
        magnolias. Between the genteel resort towns (and ferry stops) of
        Tremezzo and Cadenabbia, you’ll find one of the lake’s most beautiful
        and famous residences (open to the public), the 18th-century Villa
        Carlotta. There’s a marvelous view of the lake from its terraced
        gardens, much visited for the display of camelias, rhododendrons, and
        azaleas in late April and May.
        Lake Maggiore
        The northern, more blustery end of the lake is in
        Switzerland, but the Italian side shares the other lakes’ mellow
        climate. The resort towns offer excellent opportunities for relaxation
        and sports on longer stays, but for short visits you’ll get a better
        idea of the lake aboard a boat cruise (3–4 hours, with a meal on board,
        from Stresa, Baveno, or Pallanza) than by road.
        Stresa is Maggiore’s principal resort. The lakeside
        promenade, Lungolago, is famous for its flowers and bewitching view of
        the lake’s islands. Take the cable car to the peak of the Mottarone at
        1,491 m (4,892 ft) for an exhilarating view of the Lombardy lakes, the
        Alps, and the Po valley. A toll road will also take you there via the
        Giardino Alpinia (Alpine Garden), which displays over 2,000 varieties
        of mountain plants.
        The most popular boat trip from Stresa is to the Borromean
        Islands (Isole Borromee) (the 5-star hotel in Stresa of the same name
        was the setting for Hemingways’ Farewell to Arms), celebrated for their
        Baroque palazzi and magnificent gardens. They are still the property of
        the Borromeo family that provided Milan with its greatest cardinals.
        The 17th-century palazzo on Isola Bella is decorated with admirable
        paintings by Annibale Carracci, Tiepolo, Zuccarelli, and Giordano. The
        luxuriously planted terraced gardens constitute one of the finest
        ensembles of the Italian formal style. View the lake from the uppermost
        of the ten terraces, by the unicorn statue that is the Borromeo family
        emblem. Isola dei Pescatori (a.k.a. Isola Superiore) is a delightfully
        peaceful fishing village with tiny narrow streets, while Isola Madre,
        farther out in the lake, is the largest and most peaceful of the
        islands. It might pass for deserted, if not for the peacocks and
        pheasants who inhabit the botanical gardens, and the visitors strolling
        amidst the palms and rhododendrons.

***Significant amount of the terminal output was ommitted***
        

In the first example of `grep -v`, I typed `grep -v "Lucayans" travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt` into the command line. 
In our skills demo, one of our tasks was to return the name of the file with the word "Lucayans" in it. What I did here is I searched 
for every line in this file that ***didn't*** contain the word "Lucayans". As you can see, there is absolutely no mention of that specific word in the 
terminal output, showing that this command is an inverse search command. In the second example, I typed `grep -v "Italy" 
travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToItaly.txt` into the terminal. Every line that didn't contain the word Italy was printed out in the terminal. This command
is quite helpful because if you need to find a specific set of information, you can start by excluding the irrelevant information that you know you 
don't need. For example, if you wanted to find information about the countries you haven't visited yet, you could switch into the written_2 directory,
use `grep -v "country_name" ` and find information about every other country. The source of where I found this command can be found [here](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/03/15-practical-unix-grep-command-examples/)

Amsterdam Bos is more than a park. It has meadows, woodland, and a huge lake for rowing, sailing, and hourly row-boat hire. It features nature reserves, animal enclosures, and a botanical garden. There is also an open-air theater, which holds performances in the summer.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt:One of the major questions still facing the Bahamas is how to accommodate the increasing numbers of tourists while still preserving the special architectural and social heritage of the Out Islands, as well as of the major towns like Nassau.

At the moment, the thinking is that it’s perhaps best to leave these smaller, less developed islands in peace.

travel_guides/berlitz2/Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt:Farther north, in a working class neighborhood on the rising slope of the hills behind Gràcia, Parc Guëll, another wildly ambitious Gaudí project, is a residential community completely intertwined with nature. Although this project too was never completed according to plan, it is a marvelous place to visit: part park, part Hansel-and-Gretel fantasyland. Gaudí’s patron Eusebi Güell bought 6 hectares (15 acres) here, overlooking the city and the sea, intending to create a community of villas. He gave Gaudí carte blanche to produce something original, and for the next 14 years, on and off, the architect delighted in letting his imagination run wild. A gingerbread gatehouse guards the entrance on the carrer d’Olot; a tiled lizard fountain gurgles water from its jaw; supporting columns mimic tree trunks. Ceilings are decorated with broken plates, and wildly undulating benches are splashed with dizzying broken ceramics, Gaudí’s beloved trencadis.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Beijing-WhereToGo.txt:Beijing’s most active Daoist complex, Bai Yun Guan, is better known as White Cloud Temple. This is also the capital’s most fascinating religious site, a place of superstition and incense, mystery and spirited worship. As China’s leading indigenous religion, Daoism differs from Buddhism (transplanted from India) not so much in the architecture of its temples and the art of its statuary (these are often quite similar in style) as in its practices and beliefs. Daoism emphasized nature, the individual, and the Way, but in its organized form it relies on a huge pantheon of gods, goddesses, and supernatural icons promising miracles.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Berlin-WhatToDo.txt:Another long-standing Berlin tradition, at its heyday in the 1920s, satirical cabaret has always, by its very nature, had to struggle for its existence. Berlin has seemed to provide the necessary raw material, a perennially turbulent history to which reunification has not put a stop. Two survivors among the countless fly-by-nights are Die Stachelschweine (The Porcupines, Europa-Center) and Die Distel (The Thistle, Friedrichstraße 101). However, unless your German is excellent and you have an in-depth understanding of the political scene, this kind of cabaret will be almost impossible to follow.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Berlin-WhereToGo.txt:A ferry links Pfaueninsel (Peacock Island), a delightfully tranquil nature reserve in the Havel, towards the northern edge of Berliner Forst. The island menagerie was used to stock the Berlin Zoo, but the bird sanctuary still has much to offer the nature-lover including, of course, peacocks.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Berlin-WhereToGo.txt:To the north of the borough, Spandauer Forst is half the size of the Grunewald, but equally beautiful. The forest contains nature reserves where you will find rare plants protected in their wild state. Teufelsbruch, for example, which regularly records the coldest winter temperatures in Berlin, provides a natural shelter for shrubs and flowers from the sub-Arctic tundra. Just to the east of Teufelsbruch, summer bathing and camping are popular at Bürgerablage beach on the Havel.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt:After leaving the perfumery, head back toward the Swizzle Inn and turn right at Wilkinson Avenue (by Bailey’s Ice Cream Parlour). From here it is only a five-minute walk to Crystal Caves. The unique geological conditions that formed Bermuda created a number of cave systems. Experts claim that there are many yet to be explored and charted, and perhaps the Crystal Cave system might itself have been left undiscovered were it not for a quirk of fate. In 1907, two young boys were playing cricket, and after a particularly good stroke they lost the ball down a small sinkhole. They decided to try to retrieve the ball and, with ropes and lanterns, they entered the hole and discovered a magical landscape 37 m (120 ft) underground. They never did find their cricket ball, but when you enter the caves you will understand why they became distracted from their original purpose. The caves have cathedral-like dimensions, with hundreds of stalactites and stalagmites hundreds of thousands of years old. The stalactites grow at a rate of 1 cm (about a half inch) every 100 years, so it is easy to begin to estimate the age of the largest structures. A clear tidal lake sits at the bottom of the cave, spanned by a pontoon bridge so you can explore the interior. Strategic lighting shows the formations to their best effect — and nature at its most awe-inspiring. 
travel_guides/berlitz2/Budapest-WhereoGo.txt:If you prefer entertainment of a slightly less highbrow nature, then continue north for a block to the area known as “Budapest’s Broadway,” where you will ﬁnd several theatres and nightspots.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Budapest-WhereoGo.txt:A museum of an altogether more restrained nature lies just beyond Erzsébet körút, at Hársfa utca 47. The Philatelic Museum (Bélyeg Múzeum) contains every stamp issued by the country from 1871 onwards, and so provides its own miniature pictorial history of the country.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Budapest-WhereoGo.txt:One of the most attractive spots on Lake Balaton is the village of Tihany. The place gives its name to a peninsula which almost cuts the lake in two and ends at the ferry point of Tihanyi-rév, where there is a Club Med-style camp and hotel offering a gamut of entertainment. The peninsula is unspoiled and protected by its National Park status. It even has its own small lake, popular with bird-watchers and nature lovers. To the south are the domes of former geysers.
travel_guides/berlitz2/California-History.txt:The Indian tribes lived in harmony with nature. Anticipating 1960s flower children seeking drug-induced enlightenment, medicine men drank the juice of the jimson weed to provoke revelatory hallucinations. However, not even their wildest visions prepared them for the arrival of bearded men armed with swords and crossbows, in whose wake the Indian population plummeted from a peak of 275,000 to a mere 16,000 at the start of the 20th century.
travel_guides/berlitz2/California-WhereToGo.txt:The best introduction to the forest is Congress Trail. It’s an easy 2-mile (3-km) walk, but worth lingering over for a couple of hours to absorb the beauty of the largest living creations in nature. The trail begins at the General Sherman Tree, the biggest of them all. Measuring 274 ft (84 m) tall, 103 ft (31 m) around its base and still growing, it’s one of the largest living organisms in the world. Reaching up for light well above the rest of the forest, the first branches start 130 ft (40 m) above the ground.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:Niagara Falls, Ontario, has, to the chagrin of many American tour operators, the best grandstand view of one of the Western World’s great natural wonders. Southern Ontario’s countryside is a gentle green delight enhanced by two theater festivals, the Shaw festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake and the Shakespeare festival at Stratford. Cruise around the Great Lakes, try the watersports on Georgian Bay, and explore the Thousand Islands or Point Pelee nature reserve.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:The true marvel of Niagara is how nature manages to triumph over tawdry commercialism, perhaps less strident on the Canadian than on the American side of the border marked by the Falls. No amount of pushy peddlers or tacky pink honeymoon motels (if you do stay overnight, ask to see one of the hilarious bridal suites) can diminish the spectacle of that mass of white water taking its awesome plunge on the way from Lake Erie towards Lake Ontario and the Atlantic.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:At the southern end of the peninsula, indeed the southernmost point of the Canadian mainland, Point Pelee is one of the most distinctive of the country’s nature reserves. It’s on the same latitude as northern California or Rome, and so endowed with a most un-Canadian climate and vegetation that offer a hospitable crossroads for 347 species of birds on their biannual north–south migrations.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:Go hiking or biking on well-planned nature trails (details can be obtained from the Old Chelsea Visitors Center). Besides swimming at five public beaches, you can rent canoes and rowboats for fishing on Philippe and La Pêche lakes. Visit Kingsmere, the charming estate where William Lyon Mackenzie King spent his last years. As well as exploring the occult — he spoke to his departed mother through a crystal ball — Canada’s longest-serving Prime Minister liked to collect “ruins” on his many world travels. Among others, you’ll find in his gardens pieces of London’s House of Commons, brought back after the Blitz of World War II.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:The full natural beauty of the Laurentians is best appreciated in Mont-Tremblant Provincial Park. Rent a canoe or kayak to explore some of the 500 lakes and rivers that sparkle across an area of 1,500 sq. km (579 square miles). It was the rush of those streams that inspired the Algonquin name Manitonga Sontana, Mountain of the Trembling Spirit, emitting its muffled boom when man disturbed its peace. Mont-Tremblant’s 1,058-m (3,175-ft) Johannsen peak is the highest in the Laurentians. At the St-Donat reception center or other entry points to the park, you’ll find detailed maps of self-guiding nature trails with signposts describing the forest’s flora and fauna. The park also provides forest guides for group tours. The park’s wildlife, even more abundant in the Rouge-Matawin Nature Reserve to the north, includes moose, deer, black bear, otter, mink, muskrat, fox, and beaver. Birdwatchers may spot grouse, loon, heron, finches, and warblers, while anglers can hope to catch speckled and lake trout, pike, bass, and walleye.

Another way in which I used this string search command is with the command `grep " tropical" */*/*.txt */*/*/*.txt`

Here is the output for this command:

```
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch2.txt:A row of no-nonsense 1970s office blocks lines Sixth Avenue on the west side of the park. The largest is the New York Telephone Company Building, whose banal façade of gray-tinted glass and vertical strips of marble fills the block between 41st and 42nd Street. The north side of the park is dominated by the fifty-story W. R. Grace Building, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1972. The swooping travertine façade appears to have been inspired by the buildings of Brasília. This bit of tropical flash is flanked by an undistinguished mirrored glass tower, and a generic brick-and-Colonial-trim box. Built 50 years apart, these commercial office blocks share a balefully functionalist approach to architecture. They are strictly off-the-rack buildings that only a developer could love.

travel_guides/berlitz2/Amsterdam-WhereToGo.txt:Southeast of Artis, across two canals and busy roads, is Oosterpark, an open green area with a lake and play areas (we would suggest taking a tram — numbers 9 and 14 — rather than walking here from the city center). In the northern corner of the park is the Tropenmuseum, once the home of the Dutch Colonial Institute. The building itself was built in 1926 and built especially to house the institute’s collection of artifacts from the tropics.Today the aim of the museum is to improve our knowledge of the world’s tropical areas, and promotes an understanding of the peoples in these developing parts of the world. A vast collection of artifacts from the former Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) was the starting point for the displays, which range from tribal masks to tools and utensils in daily use. Recreations of a Bombay street and Arab souk, among other locales, bring home the reality of life in these very different societies. The museum also has a Kindermuseum (Children’s Museum) offering 6–12 year olds a chance to explore the collection and interact with the exhibits. Special guides lead children through the artifacts and explain their context. The Kindermuseum must be booked in advance and at present the tours are in Dutch only.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:Nearby is Ardastra Gardens, Zoo, and Conservation Centre, a landscaped park famed for its pink flamingos, which are paraded three times a day into a small enclosure to offer visitors a closer look. These birds, once common in certain Bahamian islands, are now disappearing, though the reasons for the decline are disputed. Another endangered species, the Bahamian Parrot, is under threat from loss of habitat. The Gardens is one of only a small number of centers that has developed a breeding program for this vocal and gregarious bird in the hope of replenishing colonies in the wild. There are many more species of Caribbean mammals, reptiles, birds, and fish to find as you explore the 51⁄2 acres of tropical parkland.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:At Andros Town, known as Fresh Creek to local people, there are a few facilities for visitors and a number of small hotels. One of the most popular Bahamian souvenirs is produced nearby. Androsia batik — brightly colored cotton fabric with tropical fish, turtle, or fruit motifs — is hand-produced at a small factory just outside the capital. You can watch the patterns being pressed in wax onto the white cotton fabric and view the skeins as they’re allowed to dry naturally in the warm Bahamian sun. The finished batik is then used to make clothing and other products in the small factory next door. The products are available in shops all over the Bahamas, but you can save a good deal by buying direct from the factory.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:South of metropolitan Miami, you’ll see hundreds of colorful parrots, macaws, flamingoes, and other tropical birds in the rain forest foliage of Parrot Jungle. Another park where you can meet the animals is Monkey Jungle. Metrozoo, a cageless facility, displays animals compatible with the south Florida climate.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bali-WhereToGo.txt:In atmosphere, Sanur falls somewhere between the brash, noisy Kuta and secluded, pricey Nusa Dua. Half-hidden by tropical gardens and foliage, many of Sanur’s hotels are small in scale, and face the pleasant, sandy beach. The water is generally calm, protected from waves and undercurrents by an outlying coral reef. At high tide, the swimming is wonderful, but at low tide, the water dips to knee or waist level, and wading is the only activity possible. Beyond the reef are massive pounding waves, a challenge for experienced surfers.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bali-WhereToGo.txt:Considered one of Bali’s oddities, the Bat Cave and its temple are hemmed in by souvenir stalls, hawkers, sash dispensers, donation collectors, ticket sellers, and, for most of the day, parked tour buses. Once past this obstacle course, you’ll see the cave mouth and a seething mass of leathery bats clinging to the rock face, here and there dropping off, circling and then coming in to land again. They can’t all find a place in the cave, so some hang outside in broad daylight. If you are staying anywhere near, perhaps at Candi Dasa, you might time a visit here for dusk. That’s when the bat colony pours out of the cave like a liquid black stream and wheels away into the distance to feed on the myriad insects of the tropical night. 
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt:From Front Street, a ten-minute walk up the steep incline of King Street leads to Fort Hamilton, which was built in 1889 to protect the harbor and formed part of a line of defense for the naval dockyard to the west. Today it offers spectacular views over the rooftops of Hamilton, especially thrilling when the cruise ships are in port. The upper levels and battlements have been landscaped with fine lawns, which make a fine place for a summer picnic. Long, cool tunnels in the depths of the defenses were originally dug as a protected route for ammunition replenishment. They also lead to the deep moat, once the first line of protection against manned assault but now converted into a splendid tropical garden with varieties of giant bamboo, fern, and ficus. Creeping plants now climb the sheer walls, providing a new home to numerous birds, lizards, and frogs. Every Monday from November to March, the fort hosts a display by the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band, complete with kilts and highland dancers.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt:Middle Road eventually reaches the village of Flatts at the edge of Harrington Sound. The sound, some 3 km (2 miles) in diameter, is thought to be a huge caldera that formed after a powerful volcanic eruption. Some areas of this inland sea are immensely deep, attracting marine creatures to the safe waters. Boats also take advantage of the protective shield, and in summer (April–October) diving and snorkeling are popular pastimes. A narrow bridge fords the gap between the sound and the open sea through Flatts Inlet. The tidal waters are constantly flowing in and out through the 9-m (30-ft) opening. A number of boats rest on the waters of Flatts Inlet, which is one of the most photogenic spots on the island. The waters have a translucent turquoise hue that appears almost artificial, and the swaying palms create a truly tropical scene.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt:The South Road (bus route #1) leads east from the Hamilton area, through Paget and Devonshire parishes to the southern edge of Harrington Sound and then on toward Castle Harbour. There are many large private houses here in the southeast part of the island, standing proudly behind tropical gardens. About a mile beyond the Botanical Gardens (see page 42), there is a narrow turnoff from the main road leading to Devonshire Bay. In summer, fishermen land their catches in the bay and sell them from small stalls set on the flat rocks surrounding the beach. 
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt:On your way up Harrington Sound Road, you will come to Lemington Caves, a series of caves smaller than Crystal Caves but equally spectacular. Watch also for Walsingham Lane and a sign to Tom Moore’s Tavern, named after the Irish poet who spent some time on Bermuda. The tavern (which is in fact a restaurant with French and local cuisine) is open only in the evening. In the daytime you can visit Idwal Hughes Nature Reserve, also along Walsingham Lane — a pristine area of natural habitat. Collapsed limestone caves and tidal seawater mangrove swamps provide a perfect home for herons, tropical frogs, and many species of fish.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Boston-WhereToGo.txt:On Central Wharf, the New England Aquarium is one of the best anywhere. Its centerpiece is a giant 200,000-gallon tank containing a 24-ft- (7-m-) deep coral reef filled with sharks, sea turtles, and 600 fish from 100 species. Five times a day, scuba divers go in to feed the fish, a fascinating spectacle to watch. Ramps circle the tank so that you can walk around the whole thing. More than 70 exhibit tanks make up the Aquarium galleries. They are categorized as salt or fresh water and feature communities of fish inhabiting different marine climates, from cold and temperate to tropical. Visitors can see the life forms found in a salt marsh, a mangrove swamp, or along the New England seashore. Kids love the Touch Tide Pool where they can handle crabs and starfish. Other perennial favorites are the penguins, the sea otters, and the sea lions, who provide entertainment in the theater. The aquarium is currently undergoing an expansion that will triple its size. The new West Wing containing a large outdoor seal exhibit, two floors of exhibits, plus visitor facilities opened in 1998. A large-format theater will open in 2001 and the new East Wing in 2003.

The function of this command is to return the files that contain the specified string along with the exact line that the string can be found in.
In the output, you can also see the file name printed alonside a larger excerpt that contains the string. In the first example, I used the command
`grep " nature" */*/*.txt` to print the names of files with the word "nature" in them that are located within `travel_guides`. As seen in the output,
the file names, lines, and paragraphs with the word "nature" in them were all printed in the terminal. In the command, I specifically added a space 
before the word " nature" because inputting "nature" can return lines that contain words with "nature" in them, such as "signature", so it's important 
to be careful when matching individual words. For the second command, I searched for the word "tropical" in all the files in `written_2` using the 
command `grep " tropical" */*/*.txt */*/*/*.txt`. All text files within `written_2` with "tropical" in them, along with the specific line and paragraph 
were also printed. This command is particularly useful if you can't remember the name of a file but can remember a specific string contained in that 
file, you can easily search for it using this command. My source for where I found this command can be found 
[here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/806-7612/filesearch-99633/index.html#:~:text=The%20grep%20command%20can%20search,the%20line%20matching%20the%20pattern.)

to see how many times the word "volcano" appears in every text file in written_2. As seen in the output, most files don't contain "volcano" since most
of the file names have a zero next to them. However, there are certain instances, namely in text files about Japan and Hawaii, in which that is not the
case. For my second example, I used the command `grep -c "museum" */*/*.txt */*/*/*.txt` to search for the number of times "museum" appears in all of the 
text fies in written_2. For the most part, the `WhereToGo` files are the ones that contain the word "museum", and this can be seen in the code block 
above. This command is particularly useful because if you want to find files whose contents pertain to a certain topic/idea, you can input certain
key words to see which text files may cover that area. I found this command at [this source](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/03/15-practical-unix-grep-command-examples/)

__Fourth Use___ `grep -r` __or recursive searching__

For my first example of recursive searching, I used the command `grep -r "Phidias" *`

The output can be seen here:

```
        grep -r "Phidias" *
        
        travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToItaly.txt:        in fame among Greek sculptors only to Phidias. The Emperors’ Gallery
        
```
---
For my second example example of recursive searching, I used the command `grep -r "Fiji" *`

The output can be seen here:

```
        grep -r "Fiji" *
        travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToLosAngeles.txt:        fishing trips can be arranged. Fisherman’s Village on Fiji Way attracts
       
 ```
 
 The function of the `grep -r` command is similar to that of the second command that I tried (the normal grep search command) except it 
 recursively searches through the current directory ***and*** it's subdirectories, which is similar to how the `find` command works.
 Instead of having to type out `*/*/*/*.txt` & `*/*/*.txt`, I can simple just put an asterisk to search every file in every subdirectory of 
 `written_2`. The benefits of this command are similar to that of the normal search, if you can't remember the name of a file but can remember a specific 
 string contained in that file, you can search for it along with having the added benefit of checking all subdirectories and files with just an asterisk.
 For my first example, I searched all of the files in `written_2` for the word "Phidias". The terminal outputted the specific file 
 along with the exact sentence in which you could find the word. For my second example, I searched all of `written_2` for the word "Fiji", which returned
 one file and the line in which "Fiji" can be found. My source from which I found this command can be [seen here](https://linuxhint.com/use-grep-recursively/)
