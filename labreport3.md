A Brief History
English sea captains also came to know the beautiful but deserted Bahamian islands during the 17th century. England’s first formal move was on 30 October 1629, when Charles I granted the Bahamas and a chunk of the American south to his Attorney General, Sir Robert Health. But nothing came of that, nor of a rival French move in 1633 when Cardinal Richelieu, the 17th-century French statesman, tried claiming the islands for France.
Colonization and Piracy
In 1648 a group of English Puritans from Bermuda, led by William Sayle, sailed to Bahamian waters and established the first permanent European settlement on the island they named Eleutheria (now Eleuthera) after the Greek word for freedom. The 70 colonists called themselves the Eleutherian Adventurers, but life was very difficult and the colony never flourished, though Sayle was long honored for the effort. In 1666 a smaller island (called Sayle’s island) with a fine harbor was settled by Bermudians and renamed New Providence. It was later to become known as Nassau, capital of the Bahamas.
In 1670 six Lords Proprietors of Carolina were granted the Bahama islands by Charles II, but for nearly 50 years their weak governors on New Providence either couldn’t or wouldn’t suppress the piracy raging through the archipelago. Then, in 1684, to avenge countless raids against their ships, the Spanish dispatched a powerful squadron from Cuba to attack Nassau. This sent the majority of the English settlers fleeing to Jamaica or Massachusetts, but didn’t have much effect on the pirates.
Most feared of the 1,000 or more swashbucklers operating from the New Providence lair was Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard. Today you can visit a tower east of Nassau named after him. Another two infamous pirates were women: Anne Bonney and Mary Read had exceptionally bloodthirsty reputations and are still celebrated in the Bahamas. The pirates raided anything on the sea, living totally lawless — and often not very lengthy — lives. Moreover, there was not always a clear distinction between pirates and privateers, the latter officially authorized by their governments to plunder enemy ships during time of war. Anarchy and confusion reigned throughout the area.
In 1718, shortly after the Bahamas became a crown colony, Captain Woodes Rogers, a renowned ex-privateer, was named the first royal governor. Arriving in Nassau with a powerful force and promising amnesty for surrender, he became a legend by cleaning out many of the pirates and establishing some order. This incident inspired the national motto Expulsis Piratis — Restituta Commercia (Pirates Expelled — Commerce Restored), which was retained until 1971.
A few years later Rogers quit the islands only to return for a second time in 1729 after a period of bankruptcy and debtor’s prison in England. Before he died in Nassau in 1732 he had summoned the Bahamas’ first official Assembly, composed of 16 elected members for New Providence and four each for Harbour Island and Eleuthera. At this time, in all the Bahamas there were only about 2,000 settlers.
New Providence knew some spells of prosperity in the mid-18th century as privateering resumed with England at war with Spain. The town of Nassau expanded, and improvements were made between 1760 and 1768 by another revered governor, William Shirley from Massachusetts.
The American Revolutionary War
When the 13 American colonies, enraged by the Stamp Tax, got into the war that eventually brought independence, the Bahamas somewhat reluctantly found itself on England’s side. But reluctance dissolved as profits from privateering once again flowed into Nassau. This time the plundered vessels were American, but not all the victories were won by the privateers. On 3 March 1776, a rebel squadron under Commodore Esek Hopkins arrived and occupied Nassau for two weeks, a bloodless undertaking that emptied the island’s forts of arms and other military supplies. A smaller and equally non-violent American operation against the town in January 1778 lasted less than three days.
As the colonies’ war effort picked up steam, both France and Spain weighed in against the British. In May 1782, New Providence surrendered to a large Spanish-American invasion fleet from Cuba and for the next year a Spanish governor ruled the Bahamas.
News traveled slowly in those days. The Treaty of Versailles in 1783 formally restored the Bahamas to the British, but actual liberation came through a famous escapade that would never have happened in the age of the telegraph. Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Deveaux, a loyalist from South Carolina, sailed from Florida with six ships, picked up men and fishing boats at Harbour Island and Eleuthera, and “invaded” Nassau. Though vastly outnumbered and outgunned, Deveaux employed elaborate ruses with his little boats to convince the Spanish defenders that his force was overpowering. The humiliating Spanish surrender is proudly recalled in Bahamian history, even though it was all unnecessary: the peace treaty had been signed the previous week.
Deveaux was the first of some 7,000 loyalists who, with slaves and the promise of land grants, came to the Bahamas from the southern American colonies in the wake of the English defeat in the Revolutionary War. This influx profoundly affected the islands. A number of prominent Bahamians today are the descendants of loyalists or their slaves. As a reward for his efforts, Deveaux was given acreage on both New Providence and Cat Island. Other loyalists set up cotton plantations on various islands, and slaves soon became the majority of the population.
Emancipation and Decline
In the 1780s well over 100 cotton plantations were founded and flourished around the Bahamas. Prosperity from the land finally seemed a possibility. But by the end of the century cotton had fallen victim to a devastating plague of chenille bugs and exhaustion of the weak soil. Most of the planters left the islands and depression returned, only partly relieved by “wrecking,” the freelance business of salvaging cargo from the ships forever running aground in the dangerous Bahamian waters. (Some ships were deliberately misguided by lights on shore; Nassau harbor did not have a proper lighthouse until 1816).
Nassau became a free port in 1787, sparking a surge in trading activity. Loyalists built a number of the attractive colonial-style homes and public buildings still standing today, and during the War of 1812, privateers enjoyed another profitable spell against American vessels.
Slavery in the Bahamas was not as widespread or as vicious as on many sugar islands in the Caribbean. Some slaves were voluntarily freed or sold their liberty by loyalist owners. After 1804, no slaves were imported into the Bahamas. By 1822, the first registration counted 10,808 slaves on the 17 inhabited islands or island clusters. After Parliament in London abolished slavery in 1833, there was a transitional apprenticeship period of 5 years before all slaves in the colony became fully free on 1 August 1838. This included a few thousand slaves from ships captured by the Royal Navy. They were housed in specially founded settlements on New Providence and the Out Islands.
Civil War Blockade Running
Over the centuries, trouble on the nearby American continent has often meant good news for the Bahamas. When Lincoln ordered a blockade of the southern states in 1861 after the outbreak of the Civil War, the Bahamas quickly boomed. Nassau harbor was busy with ships unloading Confederate cotton and tobacco and taking aboard arms, medicine, and manufactured goods, mainly from Europe, to be run back through the northern blockade. As the war went on, speedy and camouflaged contraband vessels were built to slip past the ever-increasing Federal patrols. Profits from blockade running were incredible, and Nassau went wild. But the extravagant parties and carefree spending stopped abruptly with the North’s victory in 1865. Late the following year an immense hurricane sent a tidal wave over Hog Island (today Paradise Island), smashing Nassau’s flimsy buildings and ruining crops. Other islands were also devastated. As the Bahamas sank back into economic doldrums, citizens turned to agriculture, fishing, or salt raking. The spread of lighthouses and decent navigational charts had crippled the old standby, the wrecking trade.
For a time a new fiber called sisal seemed promising. But Bahamian soil was too poor and Mexico grew a better plant. Neville Chamberlain, future British Prime Minister, took over his family’s sisal operation on Andros in the 1890s. It failed, the natives said, because of that island’s evil elves called chickcharnies, who cast a spell on the family for disturbing the land. Hopes were raised, and also fizzled, over Bahamian citrus and pineapple. Sponging, another vitally important industry at the end of the 19th century, also had setbacks. A hurricane in 1839 drowned some 300 sponge fishermen in the ‘mud’ off Andros, and a devastating fungus some 40 years later killed almost all the sponges.
The 20th Century
Desperate for work, perhaps 20 percent of the Bahamian population left to take construction jobs in Florida between the turn of the century and World War I. During that war hundreds of Bahamians saw active service with British forces. The islands suffered food shortages and a serious bank failure, but nothing more threatening militarily than rumors of German submarines offshore.
Prohibition brought gloom to millions of Americans, but for the Bahamas it brought the biggest bonanza in history. At the end of 1919, Congress passed the Volstead Act outlawing the manufacture, sale, or transport of intoxicating beverages. The Bahamian islands (where the temperance crusade never had much chance) were perfectly placed to help thirsty Americans. For 14 years, until the controversial law was finally repealed, bootlegging changed Nassau, West End on Grand Bahama, and Bimini beyond recognition. With just as much gusto as they’d shown in the past for wrecking, privateering, and blockade running, Bahamians took to the seas with illegal liquor. Trying to outwit the US Coast Guard was risky but enormously profitable. Fortunes were made by respected Bahamian families turned liquor merchants, rum-running boat captains, notorious criminals, shady ladies, and the Bahamas government (which collected duty on temporarily imported drink).
Liquor money bought Nassau better houses, churches, lighting, water, roads, sewers, docks, and hotels. The city’s first gambling casino opened in 1920; the first daily air service from Miami began in 1929; the yacht set decided Nassau was fashionable, and many wealthy Americans as well as Prohibition millionaires built homes on the islands.
When the boom suddenly came to an end with the worldwide depression and the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, unemployment rose again, despite the first significant tourism the Bahamas had known.
In some respects, World War II put the Bahamas on the international map. The colony was chosen to have two of the sites Britain leased to the United States under Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “destroyers for bases” deal in 1940. Allied forces operated submarine-hunting and air-sea rescue stations on the islands; Royal Air Force pilots and Royal Navy frogmen were trained here, and much trans-Atlantic air traffic passed through the Bahamas.
Then, to the astonishment of the local populace, the Duke of Windsor, having given up his throne for an American divorcée, was named governor of the little colony in 1940. He and the Duchess remained until 1945.
In 1943 the Duke intervened in the investigation of the murder of Canadian multimillionaire Sir Harry Oakes, a longtime benefactor of the Bahamas who gave his name to Nassau’s first airfield. The sensational case, never solved, made world headlines for the Bahamas and is still discussed today.
After the construction of the first wartime American air bases on New Providence was completed, thousands of Bahamians left to work on farms and in factories in the United States, a migration that continued well into the postwar era. But employment opportunities began to grow at home. From 1950, a promotion campaign under Sir Stafford Sands was hugely successful in attracting tourists to the Bahamas. Denied the sun, sand, and sin of Cuba by Fidel Castro’s takeover in 1959, hundreds of thousands of American vacationers set their sights on the Bahamas. The influx was spurred by gambling, airport and harbor improvement on the major islands, and the creation of the modern city of Freeport (which had been set in motion by the so-called Hawksbill Creek Agreement of 1955). Resort hotels began to appear and the advent of air-conditioning improved the often stifling humidity of summer.
Under a new constitution in 1964, the colony was given self-government with a ministerial-parliamentary system. In 1967 elections, the Progressive Liberal Party was victorious, its leader Lynden O. Pindling becoming premier. Following a constitutional conference in London, the Bahamas became fully independent on July 10, 1973, and is now a member of the United Nations and the British Commonwealth. In August 1992 the Progressive Liberal Party, still headed by Lynden O. Pindling, was toppled by the Free National Movement after 25 years in power. Today’s prime minister is Hubert Ingraham.
Since independence the Bahamas has kept British systems of judiciary and government yet has moved closer economically to its near neighbor, the US. The Bahamian Government has deliberately pursued tourism as the major industry of the Bahamian commonwealth and is happy to welcome many millions of visitors to its shores. The growth in cruise traffic has been particularly strong. The other islands, called the Family Islands by the government but generally referred to as the Out Islands by the tourist trade, have not shared this huge growth in numbers of visitors. Together they offer tourists almost any form of vacation experience, from the bustle of the busy city to the silence of the desert island.
In the 1990s the Bahamian Government began working on ways to expand the country’s economic base. While tourism remains a top priority — the opening of the vast Atlantis resort on Paradise Island leaves little doubt about that — a number of measures have also been taken to make the country’s laws and tax codes more attractive to offshore investors. As a result, money has been making its way into financial institutions on the Bahamas from around the world, and a large number of foreign banks have opened brand-new air-conditioned offices surrounded by carefully manicured gardens.
One of the major questions still facing the Bahamas is how to accommodate the increasing numbers of tourists while still preserving the special architectural and social heritage of the Out Islands, as well as of the major towns like Nassau. Will it be possible to enjoy the natural splendors of places like Inagua without upsetting the delicate balance of nature? At the moment, the thinking is that it’s perhaps best to leave these smaller, less developed islands in peace.

        along the winding Gardesana Occidentale, which cuts through the cliffs
        of the west shore, is spectacular. The resort town of Gardone Riviera
        is much appreciated for its parks and botanical gardens and as a base
        for hikes back into the hills. Above the resort, in Gardone di Sopra,
        is a 20th-century “folly,” Il Vittoriale, the bizarre and disturbing
        hillside residence of Gabriele D’Annunzio — poet, adventurer, fascist.
        He died here in 1936: Melancholy gardens of dark laurel and cypresses
        lead up to a hilltop mausoleum of the writer’s sarcophagus flanked by
        those of his disciples. It overlooks the prow of a patrol boat that
        D’Annunzio commanded during WWI, the Puglia, hauled up the hillside as
        the crowning piece of his relics.
        Lake Como (Lago di Como)
        Embraced by green wooded escarpments and backed by
        snow-capped Alps, the lake favored by some of England’s most romantic
        19th-century poets — Words­worth, Shelley, and Byron — retains a
        certain wistful atmosphere for the leisure hours of the Milanese (it’s
        less than an hour from Milan by train or car). As at Garda, a mild
        climate nurtures luxuriant vegetation in the villa gardens and
        parks.
        The lake dramatically divides into two arms on either side
        of the pretty resort town of Bellagio, which juts out on a hilly
        promontory. Up on the heights above the town, the elegant 18th-century
        Villa Serbelloni stands in the middle of a beautiful park of rose
        trees, camelias, magnolias, and pomegranates. Now in the hands of the
        Rockefeller Foundation, its famous gardens can be visited by guided
        tour. Don’t confuse the Villa Serbelloni with the luxury lakefront
        hotel of the same name.
        The lake’s southwest arm is the most attractive for your
        excursions. From Lezzeno, take a boat cruise to see the colorful
        grottoes, and look for the waterfall at Nesso. Como itself is a large
        factory town famous for its centuries-old silk production, but it has a
        handsome Gothic-Renaissance cathedral crowned by a superb Baroque dome
        that was added in 1744 by Turin’s great architect, Filippo Juvarra. It
        stands next to the arcaded and half-timbered Broletto, 13th-century
        seat of municipal government.
        The western shores of the lake are lined with gracious
        villas nestling in perfumed gardens. At Cernobbio, the 16th-century
        Villa d’Este is now a landmark 5-star hotel, one of Europe’s most
        special. Come at least for tea or a stroll among the cypresses and
        magnolias. Between the genteel resort towns (and ferry stops) of
        Tremezzo and Cadenabbia, you’ll find one of the lake’s most beautiful
        and famous residences (open to the public), the 18th-century Villa
        Carlotta. There’s a marvelous view of the lake from its terraced
        gardens, much visited for the display of camelias, rhododendrons, and
        azaleas in late April and May.
        Lake Maggiore
        The northern, more blustery end of the lake is in
        Switzerland, but the Italian side shares the other lakes’ mellow
        climate. The resort towns offer excellent opportunities for relaxation
        and sports on longer stays, but for short visits you’ll get a better
        idea of the lake aboard a boat cruise (3–4 hours, with a meal on board,
        from Stresa, Baveno, or Pallanza) than by road.
        Stresa is Maggiore’s principal resort. The lakeside
        promenade, Lungolago, is famous for its flowers and bewitching view of
        the lake’s islands. Take the cable car to the peak of the Mottarone at
        1,491 m (4,892 ft) for an exhilarating view of the Lombardy lakes, the
        Alps, and the Po valley. A toll road will also take you there via the
        Giardino Alpinia (Alpine Garden), which displays over 2,000 varieties
        of mountain plants.
        The most popular boat trip from Stresa is to the Borromean
        Islands (Isole Borromee) (the 5-star hotel in Stresa of the same name
        was the setting for Hemingways’ Farewell to Arms), celebrated for their
        Baroque palazzi and magnificent gardens. They are still the property of
        the Borromeo family that provided Milan with its greatest cardinals.
        The 17th-century palazzo on Isola Bella is decorated with admirable
        paintings by Annibale Carracci, Tiepolo, Zuccarelli, and Giordano. The
        luxuriously planted terraced gardens constitute one of the finest
        ensembles of the Italian formal style. View the lake from the uppermost
        of the ten terraces, by the unicorn statue that is the Borromeo family
        emblem. Isola dei Pescatori (a.k.a. Isola Superiore) is a delightfully
        peaceful fishing village with tiny narrow streets, while Isola Madre,
        farther out in the lake, is the largest and most peaceful of the
        islands. It might pass for deserted, if not for the peacocks and
        pheasants who inhabit the botanical gardens, and the visitors strolling
        amidst the palms and rhododendrons.
        Piedmont (Piemonte)
        As its name suggests, this region of the fertile upper
        basin of the Po river lies in the foothills between the Appenines and
        the Alps at the French and Swiss borders.
        From the fall of the Roman Empire to the 19th century, it
        stood outside the mainstream of Italian history. Its royal House of
        Savoy walked a diplomatic tightrope between the rivalries of France,
        Switzerland, Spain, and the German emperors until the fall of Napoleon.
        The new nationalism led Piedmont into the Italian orbit at the head of
        the Risorgimento unification movement, and the House of Savoy served as
        Close links to France have left their mark. A French
        patois-like dialect is still spoken in some hill villages and you’ll
        notice bilingual street signs in the Aosta Valley (geographically part
        of Piedmont, but administratively separate). For example, Courmayeur,
        the country’s most venerable ski resort, never adopted its more Italian
        name of Cortemaggiore. The classical palaces and squares of Turin,
        Piedmont’s royal capital, are in many ways closer in spirit to France
        created has been thoroughly “Italianized” by the steady influx of
        workers from the south for the steel, chemical, automobile, and
        communications industries.
        Turin (Torino)
        Best known for its industry, most notably the giant Fiat
        and Pirelli works, the proud Piedmontese capital is far from being a
        dull or dismal factory town. It has retained the grid-like layout of
        its origins as Taurinorum, a Roman castrum. Its rise to prominence in
        urban planning; classical and Baroque palaces and monuments give its
        main streets and squares a great dignity and panache augmented by the
        city’s economic prosperity.
        The tone is set by the formal elegance of the Piazza
        Castello, dominated by Filippo Juvarra’s richly articulated Baroque
        façade for the Palazzo Madama. The original medieval castle received
        its new name when transformed in the 17th century into the royal
        residence of Vittorio Amedeo I’s widow, nicknamed “Madama Reale,” a.k.a
        Maria Cristina of France. It now houses the Civic Museum of Ancient Art
        (Museo Civico di Arte Antica) beside a splendid ceremonial staircase,
        also designed by Juvarra. The paintings include Jan Van Eyck’s
        14th-century miniatures for the Book of Hours of the Duc de Berry,
        Pontormo’s St. Michael, and a particularly handsome Portrait of a Man
        by Sicilian master Antonello da Messina. On the upper floors are the
        royal collections of furniture, ceramics, and carved ivories.
        Across the square is the former royal chapel, the
        17th-century church of San Lorenzo, designed by Turin’s other great
        Baroque architect, Fra Guarino Guarini. Philosopher and mathematician
        as well as priest, he has created a marvelously intricate interior
        surrounding the octagonal space with 16 red marble columns. Arches rise
        to hold the central lanterned cupola formed by an 8-pointed star.
        The Royal Palace (Palazzo Reale) was the ornately Baroque
        home of the Savoy princes from the mid-1600s to 1865. After strolling
        through one sumptuous room after another, visit the wing that houses
        the Armory (Armeria Reale), for a look at the important collection of
        Asian and European weapons and armor dating back to Roman and Etruscan
        relax a while behind the Palazzo Reale in its Royal Gardens (Giardini
        Reali), designed by Louis XIV’s Tuileries and Versailles
        landscape-architect, André Le Nôtre.
        The late 15th-century cathedral (Duomo di San Giovanni)
        the shroud said to have wrapped Jesus after his descent from the cross,
        taking the imprint of his face and body. Sometimes enshrined in the
        Chapel of the Holy Shroud (Cappella della Santa Sindone), it was
        brought to Turin in the 17th century after a journey 200 years earlier
        from Jerusalem to France via Cyprus. Measuring 4.1 by 1.4 m (13 by 5
        ft), the sheet is kept in an iron-lined silver casket placed in a
        marble urn and tucked away in the Museo della Sidone, and is rarely on
        display to the public (with the recent exception of the Holy Year
        2000). During the occasions that it is on display, it is brought to the
        chapel. Many dispute the modern scientific tests that have proven it to
        be a medieval fabrication, and crowds of faithful and merely curious
        still visit its black marble chapel, a masterpiece of Guarini’s High
        Baroque, with its cone-shaped, six-tiered dome formed by a web of
        intersecting arches that rise to a 12-pointed star. It was recently
        restored after a 1997 fire that left the city, and the nation, alarmed
        at how close it came to being completely destroyed.
        The pride of Turin, as in so many Italian cities, is not
        in one monument but in a glorious square, the Piazza San Carlo and
        Piazza Santa Cristina, one of the most beautiful in Europe. The
        17th-century palazzi make an exquisite setting for your late afternoon
        passeggiata along the arcades of shops and cafés, culminating in the
        graceful symmetry of two Baroque churches, Juvarra’s Santa Cristina and
        its twin, San Carlo. Stretching north and south of the square is the
        town’s most elegant shopping street and main axis, Via Roma.
        Northeast of the piazza, in the Palazzo dell’Accademia
        delle Scienze, is the Egyptian Museum (Museo Egizio), second in
        importance only to the one in Cairo. The Savoys’ collection of more
        than 30,000 items is on display, including priceless treasures such as
        the staggering variety of statues of the Pharaohs of the period around
        1500 b.c. Smaller artifacts of everyday life are just as
        fascinating — combs, clothes, kitchen utensils, even food found in a
        well-preserved 14th-century b.c. tomb.
        Pace your stamina for the second floor’s excellent
        Galleria Sabauda (Savoy Gallery), with an important collection of
        Italian and European art, also due to the Savoys’ penchant for
        collecting. The Italian works include a Fra Angelico Virgin and Child,
        Vero­nese’s Supper at Simon’s House, and Pollaiuolo’s Tobias and the
        Archangel. But the Savoys also favored the Flemish, Dutch, and Northern
        includes Jan Van Eyck’s St. Francis Receiving the Stigmata and works by
        Roger Van Der Weyden, Van Dyck, Rembrandt, Hans Memling, and François
        Clouet.
        One of the city’s more bizarre monuments is the Mole
        Antonelliana, with its swordfish-like 167-m- (547-ft-) high granite
        spire, named after its engineer designer Alessandro Antonelli. Planned
        originally in 1863 as a synagogue and for many years the world’s
        tallest building, it’s now a beloved city icon used for exhibitions and
        elevator trips to its panoramic terrace.
        Automobile buffs from all over the world come to check out
        the Italian designing talents of Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Bugatti, and Ferrari
        (but also Benz, Peugeot, and Ford) celebrated out at the Museo
        dell’Automobile (Corso Unità d’Italia, 40), south of the city center
        beside the Po river.
        Take the pretty excursion up on a hill across the river to
        Sassi, 10 km (6 miles) east of Turin, to see Juvarra’s Baroque
        masterpiece, the splendid domed Basilica di Superga completed in 1731
        and the hilltop view of Turin, the Alps, and the Po Plain. It is
        something of a pantheon for the House of Savoy, buried in the
        basilica’s Crypt of Kings.
        Courmayeur
        The 4,810-m (15,781-ft) peak of Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco)
        may be in France, but the Italian side of the mountain gets the better
        weather. The Aosta Valley’s Courmayeur is as pleasant a base for
        hiking — and more strenuous mountain-climbing — in summer as it is for
        Museum traces its history in the Casa delle Guide (Maison des Guides).
        With fine hotels and fashionable boutiques, Courmayeur’s lost innocence
        is easily captured in Entrèves, its quiet, little-sister neighbor 3 km
        (2 miles) to the north.
        One of the most spectacular excursions in the whole
        country is the dramatic cable car ride from La Palud, north of
        Courmayeur, to the Colle del Gigante, 3,354 m (11,004 ft) and Aiguille
        du Midi, 3,842 m (12,606 ft) down to Chamonix in France. You’ll have
        breathtaking views across to the peak of Mont Blanc and the whole roof
        of the western Alps. (The Aiguille cable car station is across the
        French border, so take your passport if you care to descend at any
        point on French soil. )
        Italian Riviera
        The Ligurian coast that holidaymakers have dubbed the
        Italian Riviera has an ancient history of piracy and commerce, not
        always easily distinguishable. The great port city of Genoa made the
        Mediterranean more or less safe for respectable traders, and the rest
        of the coast settled down to some quiet fishing, sailing, and harmless
        traffic in postcards and suntan lotion.
        The picturesque, more rugged coast east of Genoa is known
        as the Riviera di Levante (Riviera of the Rising Sun), while the coast
        west to the French border at Ventimiglia is the Riviera di Ponente
        (Riviera of the Setting Sun), better known for the sandy beaches of its
        family resorts.
        Genoa (Genova)
        Hemmed in between the Apennine mountains and the sea, for
        centuries Genoa tended, like historic rival Venice on the east coast,
        may account for a cool reserve, almost aloofness, that some read even
        into the architecture of the tall houses in the straight and narrow
        streets behind the port.
        remains the key to the city’s identity. As an important maritime center
        for the Roman Empire, Genoa would later be put on the map of sea-faring
        annals forever as the birthplace of Christopher Columbus. The
        quincentennial anniversary celebrating his 1492 voyage saw the city’s
        historical port undergo a face-lift, and the addition of the Aquarium,
        the largest in Europe, a must-see for visitors with children.
        The main shopping street of this little-visited city is
        Via XX Settembre west of the Piazza De Ferrari that constitutes the
        city’s bustling modern center, where the city’s historic quarters
        begin. Piazza San Matteo was the medieval home of the august Doria
        family, navigators and merchants who helped build the city’s great
        commercial empire. Their arcade houses, with gray-and-white striped
        façades (numbers 15–17) were built from the 13th to 15th century. The
        Romanesque-Gothic church of San Matteo has the same gray-and-white
        façade. In the crypt, you’ll find the tomb of Andrea Doria, great
        16th-century admiral who took Genoa into the Spanish camp against the
        French and became the city’s virtual dictator.
        The Renaissance and Baroque palaces of the Via Garibaldi
        are a unique testimony to the town’s historic prosperity, many of them
        now banks or museums. The Palazzo Bianco (number 11) makes a handsome
        setting for Genoa’s most important art collection, mostly the work of
        Genoese painters: Cambiaso, Strozzi, and Magnasco, as well as works by
        Pontormo and Palma il Vecchio, and the Flemish school —  Rubens, Gérard
        David, and Van Dyck. The 17th-century Baroque Palaz­zo Rosso (number
        18), taking its name from the red façade, displays works by Veronese,
        Titian, Caravaggio, Dürer, Rubens, and Van Dyck.
        Not only did his home town not finance his crazy trip to
        America, but Genoa still has no decent monument to Christopher
        Columbus. The closest reference you’ll find is on a ramp leading to the
        Port a Soprana, a medieval turreted gate on Piazza Dante, where there
        is an obscure plaque indicating the house of the discoverer’s
        father.
        Riviera Resorts
        Along the mostly rugged Riviera di Levante east of Genoa,
        by far the prettiest spot is tiny Portofino, seemingly more fishing and
        sailing harbor than resort, but look and you’ll find some fine hotels
        and private villas back in the forest-covered hills. From the
        colorfully painted houses clustered around the postage stamp-sized
        harbor, avoid the crowds of day-trippers by setting out on a paved
        cliff walk. Pass the yellow-painted church of San Giorgio to the
        lighthouse (faro) at the end of the government-protected Promontory
        Monte Portofino for a superb view along the coast. The cliffs are
        clothed in a profusion of exotic vegetation, with occasional glimpses
        of private homes framed by cypresses, palm trees, and cascades of
        bougainvillaea. Boat excursions will take you to other beautifully
        secluded villages, such as the historic monastery of San Fruttuoso,
        reachable only by boat or a 2-hour walk, and delightfully unspoiled
        Camogli. By foot, you can also visit the charming little fishing hamlet
        of San Rocco and take a 40-minute walk over to Punta Chiappa, looking
        out over the whole Riviera. A favorite boat ride from Santa Margherita
        is the cluster of former fishing villages called the Cinque Terre,
        cliff-clinging hamlets hugging a stretch of coastline reminiscent of
        the Mediterranean one hundred years ago. Reachable only by boat until
        recently, they are linked by a network of ancient cliffside mule paths
        Santa Margherita Ligure is a lively resort town full of
        cafés, boutiques, good hotels, and a palm-lined waterfront esplanade
        with seafood-serving trattorie. It absorbs the tourism neighboring
        Positano cannot accommodate. The family resort of Sestri Levante has
        fine sandy beaches. Most popular of all, down the coast beyond the
        naval city of La Spezia, are the beaches of Viareggio, favorite Tuscan
        resort, together with its more up-market neighbor, Forte dei Marmi.
        Cool off with an excursion inland to Carrara, where the
        achievements, the monuments of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance.
        The town is still full of sculptors, and Piazza Alberica is the scene
        of a summer sculpture competition — 14 days to produce a masterpiece.
        Visit the still active quarries of Fantiscritti and Colonnata. The
        marble that Michelangelo chose for his Moses and Pietà is now hewn, at
        $3,000 a cubic meter, for replicas at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas,
        tombstones in the Los Angeles Forest Lawn cemetery, and countless homes
        of oil-rich sheiks.
        The Riviera di Ponente, west of Genoa toward the French
        border, is an almost continuous chain of family resorts. A faded resort
        of earlier times, dignified San Remo is the best known, with its
        well-heeled casino and elegant promenade along the Corso Imperatrice.
        For time away from the beach, explore the narrow, winding medieval
        streets of the hilltop La Pigna quarter, leading up to the 17th-century
        sanctuary of Madonna della Costa.
        The quieter resort of Bordighera is particularly proud of
        the palm trees along the Lungomare Argentina promenade. Since the 16th
        century, the town has had the exclusive privilege of providing Rome
        with its palm fronds for the Sunday before Easter. Alassio completes
        this coast’s trio of major resorts, justifiably proud of its gardens
        nurtured by a particularly mild winter. Take an excursion east to the
        quiet medieval town of Albenga, with its Romanesque-Gothic houses
        around the 11th- to 14th-century cathedral and early Christian
        (fifth-century) baptistery.
        THE SOUTH
        One of the great joys of the south is the extent to which
        its perennial favorites: the sister islands of Capri and Ischia in the
        Bay of Naples, the ruins of Pompeii, and the resorts of the singularly
        tourists almost as much as it has been by the national government since
        the 1871 reunification. Less prosperous than the north, it cannot offer
        the same wealth of modern hotel facilities. Monuments and museums have
        suffered from earthquakes (the last catastrophic one was in Campania
        1980), and civic neglect. But things are slowly improving and the
        compensations for the more venturesome visitor are considerable. The
        chief pleasure of the south, or Mezzogiorno, is the people, who are
        warm-hearted, outgoing, and gregarious.
        Naples (Napoli)
        The very idea of this teeming, undisciplined town once
        intimidated the faint-hearted, but the last decade has seen interesting
        change in this history-rich city of which the enterprising and cheerful
        Neapolitans are justifiably proud. For adventurous travelers looking
        for an introduction to the South, the rewards are rich. Indeed, two of
        Naples’ museums are among the most important in Europe, but they and
        the piazzas and monuments play second fiddle to the colorful street
        melodrama: around the port, the popular quarters of Spaccanapoli, even
        the more bourgeois neighborhoods of Vomero and Posillipo. You’ll want
        to spend hours in the restaurants. Naples is where pizza began (the
        region is the nation’s number one supplier of mozzarella), and
        flavorful home-cooking of fresh ingredients has been raised to an art
        form.
        The cautious tell you not to drive in Naples, where
        one-way signs are meaningless, parking is impossible, traffic is
        relentless, and red and green lights can be purely decorative. They are
        right.
        The face of Naples has been made and remade by its many
        earthquakes, permitting — imposing — transitions from Gothic to
        Renaissance and Baroque. Many of the city’s churches, palaces, and
        museums still show signs of ongoing reconstruction and restoration
        after the devastating earthquake of 1980.
        The Port and Spaccanapoli
        Traffic roars down the broad Corso Umberto I to the
        pivotal Piazza Municipio to serve the docks or spin off into the
        commercial district behind Santa Lucia, the teeming historic center of
        Spaccanapoli, or the residential districts of Vomero and Posillipo.
        Towering over the long rectangular square on its south
        side is the massive dry-moated Castel Nuovo. Originally the
        13th-century fortress of Naples’ French ruler Charles d’Anjou, it was
        rebuilt in the 15th century as a palace for the Spanish kings of
        Aragon. Entrance to what is now administrative offices and a communal
        library is between two towers on the west side, away from the harbor,
        through a fine two-story Renaissance triumphal arch crowned by a statue
        of St. Michael.
        Celebrated in song, the old popular harbor district of
        Santa Lucia is now lined with elegant hotels and restaurants, many
        overlooking the formidable medieval Castel dell’Ovo on its own islet,
        with a handful of outdoor trattorias and cafés that enjoy a unique
        setting. The waterfront walk at sunset offers timeless views of the bay
        and Mount Vesuvius, with the contemporary addition of a gleaming-white
        cruise ship or two. At the workaday zone of Mergellina at the western
        end of the harbor, the fishermen bring their morning catch into Porto
        Sannazaro.
        South of the Piazza Municipio, the Via San Carlo curves
        round to the 19th-century steel-and-glass shopping arcade of Galleria
        Umberto I, opposite the great Neoclassical temple of Neapolitan bel
        canto, the Teatro San Carlo opera house. First built in 1737 and
        rebuilt in 1816, it holds the distinction of once being under the
        musical direction of Gioacchino Rossini (1815–1822) and still
        possessing some of the finest acoustics in Europe. The solemnly
        monumental hemicycle of the Piazza del Plebiscito was laid out by
        Napoleon’s marshal Joachim Murat, when as King of Naples, he occupied
        the Spaniards’ Palazzo Reale on the east side of the piazza. The rooms
        are still decorated and furnished with the Baroque pomp of the 17th and
        18th centuries and reconstructed following Allied bomb damage in 1943.
        Its sumptuous royal apartments are the draw, but it also features
        temporary exhibits.
        Leading north from the palace, the Neapolitans’ favorite
        shopping street of Via Toledo separates the town hall (Municipio) and
        the broad commercial streets going down to the harbor from a
        checkerboard of narrow alleys to the west, a Spanish neighborhood of
        the 16th century that is now a mass of dilapidated working-class
        housing and a great opportunity for watching everyday-life.
        Via Toledo takes you into the city’s historic heart,
        Spaccanapoli (around a Roman road that “splits Naples” into upper and
        lower districts). In an area stretching from the permanently
        traffic-jammed Piazza Dante, between Via San Biagio dei Librai and Via
        Tribunali and over to the Porta Capuana, the popular image of old
        Naples survives. A permanent festival of laundry hangs across the
        narrow streets. Gossip, business, and family arguments fly between
        balconies, while ropes haul up baskets of vegetables, letters, and pet
        cats.
        For a sense of the historic neighborhood’s old splendor,
        start on Piazza Gesù Nuovo, with its characteristically extravagant
        Baroque Immacolata column (guglia) in the center. Behind an embossed
        façade, the same architectural exuberance continues inside the Jesuit
        church. But the jewel here, on the south corner of the square, is the
        14th-century Gothic church of Santa Chiara, built for the wife of
        Robert the Wise d’Anjou and retrieved from its 18th-century Baroque
        additions and 1943 firebombing. The original rose window and elegant
        porch survive and the French Gothic interior is beautifully restored. A
        number of sculpted tombs include the sculpted tombs of Marie de Valois
        (on the right) and Robert the Wise d’Anjou (d. 1343; behind the high
        altar). Next to the church are the lovely 14th-century cloisters
        (Chiostro delle Clarisse), converted in 1742 into a country garden of
        shaded walkways and Capodimonte ceramic tiles — a delightful haven of
        tranquility and one of Naples’ most charming spots.
        Take the Via Tribunali to the Franciscan church of San
        Lorenzo Maggiore, with its Baroque façade incorporating the
        14th-century marble porch, which was added after the earthquake of
        1731. Inside, the sober French Gothic chancel, exceptional in Naples
        for its ambulatory around the nine chapels, contrasts with the Baroque
        chapel left of the choir.
        The cathedral’s three original 14th-century portals are
        somewhat overpowered by the 19th-century neo-Gothic façade. Inside,
        left of the Baroque nave, go down to Naples’ earliest known Christian
        sanctuary, the fourth-century Ba­si­li­ca of Santa Restituta, in which
        the original Roman columns survived the 1688 earthquake. At the end of
        the right nave is the fifth-century domed baptistery, one of the oldest
        buildings known in Christian Europe with some original mosaics still
        intact. The cathedral’s richly Baroque Chapel of San Genaro is the
        highlight, its altar containing two phials of Naples’ beloved patron
        saint’s blood. On his much awaited feastday held twice annually (the
        first Sunday of May and 19 September), the blood is said to liquify,
        even “boil”: When it doesn’t, disaster befalls Naples. The last time it
        is said to not have liquified was 1980, the year of the great
        earthquake. Scientists don’t have an answer for this one.
        The Museums
        The roguish image of the city’s present might make it easy
        to forget the city’s glorious past. Luckily, two truly magnificent
        museums preserve the region’s treasures from the ravages of earthquake
        and theft.
        Originally a 16th-century cavalry barracks, the
        Archaeological Museum (Museo Archeologico Nazionale) is in no way a dry
        bundle of old bones and stones, but sheer pleasure for anyone even
        past. All visits to Pompeii and Herculaneum should begin or end here,
        since the world-famous collections beautifully display not only the
        paintings and mosaics buried there nearly 2,000 years ago by Mount
        Vesuvius, but a host of other sculptures from the region’s villas and
        temples, brought here for safe-keeping.
        The ground floor is devoted to sculpture, including many
        Roman copies of classics from Greece’s Golden Age in the fifth century
        b.c. , which are our only access to these lost masterpieces. The most
        famous of these is the Doryphorus (Spear-carrier) of Polycletus, second
        in fame among Greek sculptors only to Phidias. The Emperors’ Gallery
        includes busts and statues of Julius Caesar, Augustus, Claudius, and
        Caracalla.
        Most popular are the stunning Pompeii mosaics and
        Herculaneum bronzes on the mezzanine floor. The lively secular and
        pagan mosaics from Pompeii’s patrician villas make a striking contrast
        with the rigid formality of church mosaics that we see elsewhere in
        Musicians, vivid little friezes of an octopus, a cat catching a quail,
        and the huge exciting mural of Alexander driving Darius of Persia from
        the battlefield at Issus in 333 b.c. The paintings here are the best
        preserved of any from Roman antiquity — frescoes in brilliant blues,
        greens, and the inimitable Pompeii reds. The most celebrated is the
        sophisticated portrait of Paquius Proc­ulus and his Wife, depicting an
        interracial marriage. Also look for the elegant Hercules and Telephus
        and four delicate portraits of women, including Artimedes and the
        Flower Gatherer. Opened in 2000, the Gabinetto Segreto (Secret Gallery)
        displays a small but discerning collection of mosaics and paintings,
        many never before seen because of their controversial nature. It can be
        visited by guided tour only, arranged upon the purchase of your ticket
        at the museum entrance.
        The Capodimonte Museum, reopened in 2000, is housed in a
        beautifully restored 18th-century hilltop palace. The grounds offer a
        welcome rest before and after a visit to the rich and handsomely
        re-hung collection of Italian and European paintings.
        Highlights include: Giovanni Bellini’s gentle
        Transfiguration of Christ standing serenely between Moses and Elijah;
        Mantegna’s Portrait of a Boy; and Michelangelo’s drawing of Three
        Soldiers for his Vatican fresco of St. Peter’s Crucifixion. The Titian
        room contains half a dozen of his great works, among them a brilliant
        Pope Paul II with his Farnese Nephews, the artist’s daughter Lavinia
        Vecellio and Philip II of Spain. The stark realism you’ll see in
        Caravaggio’s Flagellation and the Seven Works of Mercy launched a whole
        Neapolitan school of “Caravaggeschi” displayed here. Most notable among
        the museum’s non-Italian painters are El Greco, Breughel (Blind Leading
        the Blind and the Misanthrope), Cranach, Holbein, Dürer, and a Van Dyck
        Crucifixion.
        Vomero and Posillipo
        Much of Naples’ middle class looks out over the city from
        the hilltop Vomero neighborhood in geometrically laid out, treeshaded
        streets respectably named after artists and musicians of the
        Renaissance and Baroque periods: Michelangelo, Giordano, Scarlatti, and
        Cimarosa. On the southeast edge of the Vomero hill just below the
        massive Castel Sant’­Elmo, the elegant Baroque Charterhouse Certosa di
        San Martino offers a soothing haven of tranquility in its cloisters and
        monastery gardens — and unbeatable views. The 14th-century church is
        rich in Neapolitan Baroque paintings, notably by Caracciolo, Stanzione,
        and Giordano. The monastery’s museum traces the kingdom of Naples’ long
        history in costumes, sculpture, paintings, and prints. Both children
        and adults adore the Museum of Nativities (Museo di Presepi),
        showcasing four centuries of the unique Neapolitan specialty of
        hand-crafted Nativity characters — an endless cast of angels, animals,
        peasants, shepherds, kings, and their retinue are on display.
        Campania
        The green and fertile region round Naples, between the
        Tyrrhenian coast and the western slopes of the Apennines, was colonized
        by the Etruscans and Greeks. Since time immemorial, the volcanic soil
        has produced a profusion of tomatoes, olives, walnuts, grapes, oranges,
        lemons, and figs.
        The succession of authoritarian rulers from the Middle
        Ages to the 18th century — Norman and Angevin French, German emperors,
        and the Spanish — kept in place a feudal system that has left the
        region to this day socially backward compared with the north. Village
        festivals and processions bear witness to the heavy rural attachment to
        religion and even pagan superstition harking back to ancient times.
        International vacationers have long frequented the idyllic islands in
        the Bay of Naples and the resorts of the Amalfi coast. All are in easy
        reach of Naples’ museums, the archaeological remains of Pompeii and
        Herculaneum, the Vesuvius volcano, and farther down the coast, the
        Greek temples of Paestum.
        Capri
        Ferries or hydrofoils leave from Naples, Sorrento, and
        Positano (and Amalfi in the summer months only) for this fabled island
        10 sq km (4 sq miles) in size. With its walled, garden-surrounded
        villas, mountainous terrain, and dramatic craggy coast, this
        still-beautiful island manages to cater to the boisterous fun of day
        trippers and package tours while simultaneously providing quiet
        hideaways for the idle rich. Winters here are marvelously mild and
        deserted, but even during the peak summer months you can seek out the
        island’s many enchanted corners away from the crowds. Evenings are
        immeasurably calmer, when the local folk venture out to reclaim the
        cafés and restaurants until the cool wee hours, and restore some of the
        charm and seduction for which Capri has been a magnet since the times
        of the ancient Roman emperors.
        It’s useless to apply for a special permit to bring your
        car, which is pretty much impossible (and unnecessary) during high
        season anyway. At the main harbor of Capri’s Marina Grande, take a
        convertible taxi, minibus, or the funicular railway (the most
        practical) up to the main town of Capri. You can rent a taxi for the
        day — not cheap, but negotiable. Here, souvenir shops, pricey boutiques
        and bar/cafés cluster around the pretty 17th-century domed church of
        Santo Stefano in the Piazzetta (officially though infrequently called
        Piazza Umberto I) where the funicular lets you off. Many day trippers
        see little more than this. Escape down the little paved road south of
        town to the peace of the shady Romanesque and Renaissance cloisters of
        the 14th-century Certosa di San Giacomo, or in the direction of Via
        Camerelle that eventually leads to the famous Punta Tragara lookout and
        the Faraglioni. These rocky islets carved into fantastic shapes are a
        symbol of the island’s beauty.
        Dominating the western (and larger) side of the island,
        the quieter and only slightly less crowded hillside town of Anacapri
        derives a quasi-sleepy charm from its white villas along narrow lanes
        flowering with bougainvillea. A short walk from the Piazza della
        Vittoria takes you to the island-famous Villa San Michele, home of
        Swedish doctor-writer (and great lover of Capri) Axel Munthe (d. 1949).
        The house is an intriguing mixture of Baroque furniture and Roman
        antiquities, but the main attraction is the charming garden with its
        trellised arches and dramatic overhang with magical views overlooking
        the island and the bay. Back at the piazza, take the seggovia chairlift
        for a soaring view of the whole island and some of the mainland on your
        way up to the terraced gardens and chestnut trees of Monte Solaro, at
        589 m (1,933 ft), Capri’s highest point.
        The island’s most popular excursion — prettiest by boat
        from Marina Grande, but also possible by road northwest of
        Anacapri — is to the celebrated marine cave, the Blue Grotto (Grotta
        Azzurra), most effective (and crowded) at noon. The sun shining through
        the water turns the light inside the cave a brilliant unearthly blue,
        and objects on the white sand seabed gleam like silver. Duck your head
        as the rowboat takes you through the one-m- (3-ft-) high cave entrance.
        The cave, 54 m (177 ft) long, 15 m (49 ft) high, and 30 m (98 ft) wide,
        is believed (because of the man-made niches) to have been a nymphaeum,
        a kind of watery boudoir for the Emperor Tiberius, who retired to Capri
        in the first century a.d. and built a villa directly above.
        Of the dozen villas that Tiberius built on Capri, his
        favorite island retreat, the best preserved is the ruins of Villa Jovis
        (Jupiter’s Villa, or Tiberius’ Villa), sprawling across an eastern
        promontory opposite the mainland. But come instead for the spectacular
        view from the 297-m- (974-ft-) high Salto di Tiberio (Tiberius’ Leap)
        precipice, said to be the last pleasure enjoyed by the emperor’s
        enemies before they were hurled over the edge.
        Ischia
        Lying at the western end of the Bay of Naples — reached by
        ferry or hydrofoil from Naples and Pozzuoli — the island has won the
        overwhelming favor of German and Scandinavian tourists and package
        tours in the summer, thanks to thermal springs, fine sandy beaches, and
        good facilities for watersports. Casamicciola Terme and Lacco Ameno are
        among the smarter spa resorts.
        One of the best beaches, pockmarked with volcanic steam
        spouts, is the Lido dei Maronti on the south coast near the little
        fishing village of Sant’Angelo. The island interior has a rich
        vegetation of vines, olive trees, and exotic plants. Nature lovers can
        hike (or rent a donkey) up the extinct volcano of Mount Epomeo, 788 m
        (2,585 ft), starting from Fontana for unforgettable views of the island
        and the Bay of Naples. Far less known internationally than its
        glamorous neighboring island of Capri, it is just as different in its
        volcanic topography as in atmosphere.
        Pompeii
        More than any of the empire’s colossal arenas, soaring
        aqueducts, or triumphal arches, you’ll find the everyday reality of
        Roman life in the bakeries, wine shops, groceries, and brothels of
        Pompeii, a town of about 25,000 founded before the 6th century b.c. Mt.
        Vesuvius blotted out the flourishing town along with Herculaneum on 24
        August a.d. 79, burying it under 7 m (23 ft) of ash: It is still being
        slowly excavated. It was rediscovered in 1594 by an architect building
        an aqueduct, but excavation did not begin until 1748 under the
        Bourbons, making a tremendous impact on the rest of Europe.
        The road from the main gate (Porta Marina, the gate that
        led to the sea) passes on the right of the basilica law courts and
        stock exchange to reach the Forum, the center of town and its main
        public meeting place directly facing Mount Vesuvius. Imagine a vast
        square looking originally something like Venice’s Piazza San Marco,
        with two-story porticoes running along three sides and the six-columned
        Temple to Jupiter flanked by ceremonial arches at the north end. After
        earlier earthquake damage, the temple was used as the Capitolium and
        city treasury. You can still see plinths from the square’s statues of
        local and national celebrities and the white base of the orator’s
        platform. In the northeast corner is the large, originally covered
        market (macellum), while in the southwest corner is the Basilica, the
        largest building in Pompeii.
        On the Via dell’Abbondanza running east from the Forum,
        those are ancient, not modern graffiti you find scratched and daubed in
        red on the walls of the houses and shops. Election slogans, insults,
        obscene drawings — the tradition continued today is millennia old.
        Prominent phallus signs often indicate a house of ill repute, with an
        arrow pointing upstairs to where the action was, but sometimes they
        were just a shopkeeper’s good luck sign. Notice the oil and wine jars
        in the shops, the bakers’ ovens and flour-grinding mills shaped like
        giant cotton-reels (excavators found a donkey lying by one he’d been
        turning when Vesuvius erupted).
        At the Stabian Baths (Thermae Stabianae), Pompeii’s
        largest, you can see the separate men’s and women’s facilities,
        changing rooms, with clothes-locker niches, and three baths: cold,
        lukewarm, and hot (frigidarium, tepidarium, and calidarium). The
        2nd-century b.c. Teatro Grande seated 5,000 spectators. Behind the
        stage was the Gladiators’ Barracks, where 63 skeletons were found.
        Their weapons and armor, along with Pompeii’s more fragile works of
        art, are exhibited at Naples’ Archaeological Museum (see page 173),
        which is an invaluable adjunct to your visit to Pompeii or
        Herculaneum.
        At the far end of the Via dell’Abbondanza, visit two of
        the town’s best villas: the House of Loreius Tiburtinus, for its
        beautiful peristyle garden of fountains, water channels, and cascades,
        one of them with paintings of Narcissus and Pyramus and Thisbe; and the
        House of Julia Felix, big enough to have been perhaps a luxury hotel,
        with its own bathhouse and a handsome portico of slender marble columns
        around the peristyle. Just to the south is the great Amphitheater, the
        its upper tiers.
        North of the Forum area are two of Pompeii’s most
        important sites. The House of the Vettii was owned by two wealthy
        merchant brothers whose large home is one of the best preserved and
        elaborately decorated. Outside the main site to the north, the Villa of
        Mysteries (Villa dei Misteri) is Pompeii’s other most cherished
        artistic treasure. The “mysteries” are those depicted in a vast fresco
        of a young woman’s initiation into the cult of Dionysius of Greek
        origin. Archaeologists, still unsure of what was involved, suggest that
        the gorgeously painted scenes of dancing satyrs, flagellation, and a
        woman kneeling before a sacred phallus indicate rites that the town
        preferred to keep at a decorous distance, in this splendid suburban
        villa, most likely the home of a priestess. The brilliant and little
        faded background of intense red to this day is still called “Pompeiian
        red. ”
        Vesuvius (Vesuvio)
        The old Roman name of Europe’s most famous volcano means
        “Unextinguished” — it is the only active volcano in continental Europe
        (with those on the nearby islands of Sicily and Stromboli not to be
        forgotten). In the 1980s, it was 1,281 m (4,203 ft) high, having added
        79 m (259 ft) with the big eruption of 1944 and subsequent smaller
        ones.
        Barring risks from “unscheduled activity,” you can go as
        far as the 600 m- (1,962 ft-) wide steaming crater. Exploiting the
        fertile volcanic soil, some vineyards still produce the esteemed
        Lacryma Christi white wine. The Eremo Observatory halfway up the
        mountain has been studying eruptions since 1845 and has an impressive
        display of relief plans, seismographs, and geological specimens spewed
        out of the volcano.
        Herculaneum (Ercolano)
        Herculaneum is smaller (only a fraction has been
        recovered) and less renowned than Pompeii, but its very compactness and
        better preservation give a more immediate sense of the shape and
        ambience of a whole Roman town, this one just 7 km (4 1/2 miles) from
        Vesuvius. While Pompeii was incinerated by volcanic cinders, a minimum
        of 20 m (65 ft) of ash and mud swamped Herculaneum, hardening and
        covering the houses in a protective crust that kept upper stories and
        even some of the woodwork intact.
        Rediscovered by well-diggers in the 18th century, the town
        is still being excavated, a delicate business as much of it is covered
        by the modern city of Ercolano. Much of the patrician town of only
        5,000 people was unearthed from 1927 to 1962.
        The entrance off the modern town’s Corso Ercolano takes
        you around the archaeological site for a striking view down across the
        ancient town of terraced villas from which wealthy Roman landowners
        looked out to sea towards Ischia on the horizon. The three principal
        streets dividing the town (Cardine III, IV, and V) have curbed
        pavements, lined with two-story houses with balconies and overhanging
        roofs for shade. Most visited, perhaps, are the Baths (Terme), not
        particularly lavish, but in excellent condition, well equipped and
        practically laid out with separate areas for men and women.
        At the southern end of Cardine V, the patrician House of
        the Stags (Casa dei Cervi) is named after its frescoes of two stags
        being attacked by hounds. In one of the spacious rooms off the garden
        is a statue of a shockingly drunken Hercules, alleged founder of the
        ancient town. In the middle of Cardine IV, the House of Charred
        Furniture (Casa del Mobilio Carbonizzato) has a uniquely preserved
        latticed divan bed and small table. Next door, the House of Neptune has
        lost its upstairs façade, but the ground floor wine shop with its
        narrow-necked amphoras on the shelves looks open for business. The
        inner courtyard has a lovely green and blue mosaic of Neptune with his
        wife Amphitrite.
        The grandest of the villas, the House of the Bicentenary
        (excavated 200 years after the first “dig” in 1738) stands on the
        avenue Decumanus Maximus on the northeast edge of town. It has splendid
        marble paving and, etched in the wall of one of the smaller rooms, a
        controversial cross regarded by some as one of the oldest Christian
        relics, though others insist the emblem was not adopted until the
        conversion of Constantine three centuries later.
        Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast
        The coast curving along the southern arm of the Bay of
        Naples round the Sorrento Peninsula to Salerno is one of the most
        romantic and dramatic drives in Europe. The sinuous white-knuckle
        coastal road and its sheer drop of rugged cliffs and ravines tames even
        the most audacious Italian driver. In olden days, only brigands and
        pirates ventured out here, their ruined redoubts and look-out towers
        still dotting the hillsides and promontories. Now, road-side look-outs
        tempt travelers and aspiring photographers onto jutting crags high
        above terraces of orange and lemon groves, vineyards, walnut, and
        almond trees. Surrounded on three sides by ravines above the sea, the
        pretty tree-shaded resort of Sorrento still retains something of its
        old-fashioned air, and is still the most popular and best logistic base
        for boat and car excursions along the coast and peninsula. Its local
        craftsmen are famous for their inlaid woodwork called intarsia. Compare
        their modern and sadly more commercialized wares with their
        forefathers’ elaborate Baroque furniture exhibited at the Museo
        Correale, in an 18th-century palazzo at the east end of
        town — Sorrento’s only real museum of note.
        Small, fashionable Positano spills down its hillside in a
        spectacular cascade of gleaming, bougainvillea-covered white-washed
        houses dotted with gardens of oranges and lemons and terraces of
        colorful hand-painted tiles. The pebbly beach is lined with canvas
        umbrella-shaded chairs and fishing boats, flanked by the pizzerias and
        restaurants that stay open until all hours. In the little church of
        Santa Maria Assunta, with the region’s characteristic majolica-tiled
        dome, see the 13th-century Byzantine-style altar painting. A very
        stylish international crowd keeps its many small hostelries and two
        five-star hotels always full, with a certain cosmopolitan air that
        makes this the area’s most upscale barefoot outpost. With only two
        roads to speak of, most travel is by foot up and down its endless
        staircases.
        The second most charming and lively of the coast’s
        resorts, Amalfi was once a powerful rival to the maritime republics of
        Pisa and Genoa, with trading posts in the 10th and 11th centuries in
        Palestine, Egypt, Cyprus, Byzantium, and Tunis. Its two destinies come
        together in the Piazza del Duomo, where open-air cafés and ice cream
        parlors look up a long monumental staircase to the Arab-Norman
        campanile and polychrome mosaic façade of the Romanesque cathedral,
        built as a symbol of the republic’s glory. It was begun in the ninth
        century, with its massive bronze doors crafted in Constantinople and
        added in the 11th century, and the façade added in the 13th, when the
        remains of St. Andrew the Apostle were brought to its crypt from
        Constantinople. The interlacing Arab-Norman arches of the 13th-century
        cloister, Chiostro del Paradiso, make a handsome setting for the summer
        recitals of chamber music. Take a trip to nearby Conca dei Marini to
        visit the stalactites of the Grotta di Smeraldo or Emerald Grotto,
        where the waters are as brilliantly emerald green as those of Capri’s
        Grotta Azzurra are blue, believed by many to be even more
        beautiful.
        Set back on a high ridge 362 m (1,184 ft) above and behind
        A malfi is the tiny and peaceful (but no longer unknown) village of
        Ravello, once a hideout for Romans fleeing the Huns and Visigoths.
        Today it’s a delightful resort of both modest and elegant hotels and
        villas, all stunningly situated. Directly off the main square, which is
        anchored by its imposing Romanesque cathedral built in 1076, is the
        Villa Rufolo, with its mysterious polychrome arcaded arabesque
        cloister. Its hanging gardens of exotic flowers and palm trees and
        mesmerizing views were the inspiration for Richard Wagner in 1880 and
        that of his last opera, Parsifal. They are the perfect location for
        outdoor classical concerts that take place during warm weather months.
        Reached by a rambling footpath is the 1904 Villa Cimbrone. Its
        surrounding fragrant gardens also command a marvelous vertigo-inducing
        view of the craggy coastline and cerulean blue of the Gulf of
        Salerno.
        Paestum
        colonies than this complex of wonderfully preserved Doric temples, a
        40-minute drive south from Salerno, dating back to the fifth and sixth
        centuries b.c. Standing alone in fields leading to the sea, their
        buff-stone columns take on a wonderful golden glow at sunset. Four
        temples loom over the forum and residential quarters of Poseidonia (as
        it was known before the Roman era), City of Poseidon. After the town
        was abandoned to malaria and Arab invaders in the ninth century, the
        monuments disappeared under wild vegetation until their rediscovery 900
        years later. The most spectacular, directly opposite the entrance to
        the site, is the fifth-century b.c. Temple of Neptune (a.k.a.
        Poseidon). The roof has gone, but with its entablature and 14 fluted
        columns still standing, it is, with Athens’ Theseion, the best
        preserved of all Greek temples. To the south, the more dilapidated
        Temple of Hera (also known, mistakenly, as the Basilica) is a hundred
        years older and is Paestum’s oldest, predating Athen’s Parthenon by one
        hundred years. The northernmost Temple of Ceres was built around 500
        b.c. , and was later used as a church in the early Middle Ages, as
        attested by three Christian tombs.
        Puglia
        Known to many under its Roman name of Apulia, the region
        stretches from the “spur” of the Gargano peninsula to the heel of
        undulating stony plateaus grazed by sheep and goats. Massive fortresses
        and fortress-like churches testify to the passage of the Normans and
        then the German emperors in the Middle Ages. In among the groves of
        olive, almond, and fig trees, the stones have been gathered up from
        time immemorial to build the smaller, but equally sturdy, corbelled
        trulli that crop up like so many mushroom clusters dotting the
        countryside. It is an exotically distant holiday destination popular
        with Italians and the occasional German tourist, both incredulous that
        Gargano Peninsula
        The peninsula’s seaside resorts have good beaches among
        the pine groves, first-class camping and water-sports facilities, and
        are a base for excursions and hikes into an attractive hinterland of
        rolling hills. The scenic coastal circuit begins (and ends) in
        Manfredonia, with historical attractions such as the 12th-century
        church of Santa Maria di Siponto (southwest of town), but tourism here
        attractive natural regions.
        Pugnochiuso is among the best of the beach resorts, along
        with Vieste, where Emperor Frederick II left a castle from which to
        view the Adriatic, and the pretty fishing villages of Peschici and
        Vieste climb up the rocky promontory.
        Go inland through Vico to join the wild deer for picnics
        in the Umbra Forest. Perched on the Gargano heights south of the
        forest, Monte Sant’Angelo was a major medieval pilgrimage town,
        celebrated for its fifth-century sanctuary of St. Michael in a grotto
        where the archangel appeared to the Bishop of Siponto three times. The
        sanctuary inspired the building of the great French island-monastery of
        Mont-Saint-Michel after Bishop Aubert traveled to Gargano to collect a
        piece of St. Michael’s red cloak. From a Gothic portico in the middle
        of town, beside the massive 13th-­century campanile, a staircase of 90
        steps takes you down to the sanctuary’s 11th-century bronze doors.
        Notice to the left of the altar the beautifully carved stone episcopal
        throne.
        From the north-coast resort of Rodi Garganico, you can
        take a 90-minute boat trip during the summer months out to the
        pine-tree-covered Tremiti Islands.
        Alberobello
        This agricultural town is the center of Puglia’s famous
        trulli, the white-washed cone-shaped houses with ruddy or gray
        dry-stone roofs dotting the landscape like giant spinning tops turned
        upside down. The cone is formed by small limestone slabs set in a
        spiral without mortar to bind them. Though the region’s oldest
        surviving trulli date back only to the 16th century, the construction
        technique is believed by some to be prehistoric, brought here perhaps
        from Greece or the Middle East.
        It is a joy to wander Alberobello’s two neighborhoods of
        trulli whose houses, shops, and even churches — Rioni Monti and Aia
        Piccola — are protected as a zona monumentale. Shopkeepers are happy to
        let you climb up to their roof terraces for a striking view across a
        whole fairytale forest of some one thousand trulli domes. Out in the
        country in and around Locorotondo and Selva di Fasano, you’ll find
        trulli (and trulli-inspired) farms, barns, grain silos, and even
        filling stations.
        Northwest of Alberobello, a strada panoramica along a
        ridge overlooking the Adriatic coast leads to Castellana Grotte, a
        spectacular cave system 60 m (190 ft) underground. Take a guided tour
        of the translucent stalactites reaching down to fuse with stalagmites
        in glowing columns of red, green, and pink.
        Last but not least is Puglia’s crown city, Lecce,
        understandably called “The Baroque Florence” for its plethora of
        16th–18th century palazzos of local and easily sculpted limestone.
        Foremost is the Basilica of the Holy Cross (Santa Croce), the city’s
        best example of its Baroque heyday, and the Piazza del Duomo, ringed by
        the rebuilt cathedral and neighboring buildings of similar
        pedigree.
        Sicily (Sicilia)
        The Mediterranean’s largest island is in many fascinating
        and if possible, it deserves a separate and unrushed vacation to do it
        justice. However, for anyone who has a few days to spare for a first
        glimpse, we suggest some highlights representative of its many facets:
        the capital Palermo, the ancient Greek settlements, and the pretty
        coastal resort of Taormina.
        Palermo
        This bustling capital deserves the necessary effort to get
        into its colorful past. Cleverly integrating designs of Arab and
        Byzantine predecessors, the Norman palaces and churches join the
        crumbling grandeur of Spanish Baroque façades in momentary triumph over
        the chaos of the modern port city. It’s not always an easy city to
        love, but few leave unimpressed.
        The intersection of Via Vittorio Emanuele and Via Maqueda
        is the town’s historic center, Quattro Canti (Four Corners), in a
        characteristic setting of two great Baroque churches (San Giuseppe dei
        Teatini and Santa Caterina), the monumental 16th-century Pretoria
        Fountain by a Florentine sculptor, and the piazza of the same name. The
        delightful Piazza Bellini includes the 12th-century church of San
        Cataldo with its three little red domes and Arabic inscriptions. It was
        used for a spell in the 18th century as a post office. It has been
        restored to its bare Moorish beauty. Beside it, the Norman Gothic La
        Martorana church, partly remodeled with a Baroque façade and porch, has
        a fine campanile with four storys of slender mullioned windows. Inside
        the porch, mint 12th-century mosaics show, to the right, Jesus crowning
        Sicily’s Norman king, Roger I, and to the left, his admiral, Georges of
        Antioch, at the feet of the Madonna. In the nave are more glittering
        mosaics of Christ Pantocrator (Omnipotent Lord) with angels.
        West along Via Vittorio Eman­uele, the Palace of the
        Normans (Palazzo dei Normanni) was built by the Saracens as a
        ninth-century fortress and later turned into a royal residence,
        appropriate setting for the later brilliance and luxury of Emperor
        Frederick II’s Sicilian court (see page 22). Although the interior is
        temporarily closed to the public, tour buses line up for the jewel of
        the palace (and Palermo), one of Norman architecture’s greatest
        Palatina). The noble Romanesque interior has a magnificent painted
        wooden ceiling with Arabic honeycomb motifs and stalactite pendentives.
        The mosaics of the dome and apse depict Christ Pantocrator with the
        Evangelists and Jesus blessing Peter and Paul; together with those of
        intricate geometric designs was a collaborative effort of Syrian Muslim
        craftsmen with Byzantine Christians. Contact the tourist office to
        determine when the palace reopens.
        The pink-domed church of San Giovanni degli Eremiti (Via
        dei Benedettini) is an intriguing example of 12th-century Arab-Norman
        design. Its exotic character is enhanced by the twin-columned
        13th-century cloister overgrown with tropical plants, orange, lemon,
        and palm trees.
        Housed in a 16th-century monastery, the Archaeological
        Museum (Piazza Olivella) displays superb statues and sculpted metope
        (friezes) from Sicily’s various archaeological sites, highlighted by
        those from the Greek temples of Selinunte (600–500 b.c. ), on Sicily’s
        south coast.
        Offset the historical with the theatrical, and make a
        visit to Palermo’s daily Vucciria market (entrance near Via Roma and
        Corso Vittorio Emanuele), an unmissable photo op in what is the most
        famous of the city’s daily markets. Vendors sing of their wares’
        quality in the local dialect that is a language all its own, in a
        setting that often feels more like north Africa. Sicily’s major port
        city offers fresh seafood in shapes and sizes unimagineable, and a
        number of good no-frills trattorias within or near the market promise
        an excellent, inexpensive lunch.
        Monreale
        This hilltop suburb 8 km (5 miles) southwest of Palermo
        boasts Sicily’s finest cathedral (12th-century) and one of the best
        medieval mosaic cycles in Europe. Go round to the back of the church to
        see its wonderful russet and brown stone chancel of interlacing arches,
        Gothic rose windows, and Arab windows with pointed arches. In the
        grandiose interior, the luminous 12th- and 13th-century mosaics of the
        nave and apse depict the complete cycle of the Old Testament, replete
        with a 66-ft high Christ Pantocrator with saints, while the aisle
        mosaics narrate the miracles of Jesus. The more warmly-hued human
        figures are believed to be the work of Venetian mosaicists, as opposed
        to the more rigidly formal Byzantine figures of Palermo’s Palatine
        Chapel.
        As famous as the mosaics are, the cathedral’s beautiful
        cloister offers a moment of spiritual meditation along the arcades of
        delicate carved twin chevron-fluted columns and an almost sensual
        pleasure among the exotic flowers and trees and Arab fountain of its
        garden. It is understandably a favorite spot for wedding photos.
        Agrigento
        Although known as the birthplace of the famous dramatist
        Luigi Pirandello (1867–1936), Agrigento’s Valley of the Temples (Valle
        dei Templi) is its showpiece attraction, dating back to the fifth
        century b.c. The Temple of Juno, with its sacrificial altar, stands in
        majestic isolation high on a ledge at the eastern end of the Via Sacra.
        But it is the Temple of Concord that is the best preserved Doric temple
        in Sicily (if not the world), thanks to its subsequent use as a church
        in the sixth century a.d. But the golden glow of the temples’ Doric
        columns and the idyllic setting amid acadia and almond trees on a
        precipice overlooking the Mediterranean are enough to encourage you to
        worship a whole pantheon of Greek gods. Nearby is the oldest of the
        shrines, the Temple of Hercules, 500 b.c. , whose eight 33-ft-high
        columns have been re-erected to give some idea of its magnificence.
        North of Temple Valley, next to the 13th-century Norman
        church of San Nicola, the small but important Archaeological Museum has
        a fine marble statue of Ephebus (fifth century b.c. ), a gigantic
        telamon, a 25-ft sculpted male figure used to hold up a temple roof’s
        entablature, and some superb Greek wine vessels.
        Syracuse (Siracusa)
        This east-coast Corinthian settlement, founded in 734 b.c.
        , was the most powerful of Magna Graecia’s overseas colonies and, under
        Dionysius (405–367 b.c. ), a direct rival to Athens. In its heyday, its
        population was nearly triple the size of today’s 118,000. It was here
        in the third century b.c. that the famous mathematician Archimedes is
        said to have proven his water displacement theory in the bath, and then
        run naked into the street crying “Eureka” (I have it! ).
        Syracuse’s original settlement was the port island of
        Ortigia, joined by causeway to the mainland. Two pillars surviving from
        the Greek Temple of Apollo stand like a gateway, but the Spanish era
        has given it a charming 17th-century ambience of Baroque houses with
        iron balconies supported by floral carvings and an occasional stone
        nymph. The graceful crescent-shaped Piazza del Duomo is the perfect
        place for breakfast surrounded by 17th- and 18th-century palazzi and
        the monumental façade of the cathedral. The church is in fact a Baroque
        elaboration of the Greeks’ Temple of Athena (fifth century b.c. ), with
        its columns incorporated into the masonry of the outside walls. On the
        island’s west side, the Fontana Aretusa is a freshwater spring (just
        steps from the ocean) with black-and-white ducks swimming in its
        semi-circular papyrus pond.
        The principal excavated site, Zona Archeologica, is
        located on the northwest corner of the modern city. Rebuilt by the
        Romans to hold 15,000 spectators (one of the largest of the ancient
        world), the Greek Theater dates back to the fifth century b.c. when
        Aeschylus himself arrived from his home at Gela to supervise
        productions of his tragedies. A classical drama festival is held here
        in May and June. The nearby Paradise Quarry (Latomia del Paradiso)
        provided the city’s building materials and is now a pleasant garden of
        oleander and orange trees. Its popular attraction is the cave called
        Orecchio di Dionisio (Dionysius’ Ear), dubbed as such by Caravaggio in
        1608 because of its acoustics.
        Syracuse’s history merits the world-class Museo
        Archeologico Paolo Orsi (Viale Teocrito). It is arguably the best in
        Sicily, an invaluable one-stop crash course in understanding the Greek
        and other ancient cultures of the city and island.
        Taormina
        Sicily’s most attractive resort town, already very popular
        in antiquity as a vacation spot for the Greek bourgeoisie from
        Syracuse, commands a splendid ridgetop view of the Mediterranean from
        its hillside villas and hotels. A popular port-of-call for countless
        cruise lines, the international crowds can be avoided for those lucky
        enough to be spending the night (a funivia cable car connects the
        hilltop town with Mazzarò Beach below). No Sicilian passeggiata is more
        celebrated than a promenade on the elegant pedestrian shopping street
        of Corso Umberto and out along the Via Roma, or through the subtropical
        vegetation of the terraced Public Gardens. With postcard panoramas
        south along the coast and to the volcano of Mount Etna to the west, the
        Greek Theater (third century b.c. ) is the only required site in town.
        It provides a uniquely gorgeous setting — if not slightly surreal — for
        the summertime festivals of classical drama, music, and film.
        Excursions further up the mountain take you to two medieval fortresses,
        on foot to Castello di Taormina and, by car along a winding road, to
        Castelmola, for grand views, although the summit of Etna is almost
        always swathed in clouds.
        Mount Etna
        Europe’s tallest volcano is still very active, as you’ll
        see from the tell-tale yellow sulphur stains of mini-eruptions as you
        approach the crater, where the lava beneath your feet is still warm.
        The lunarscape-like summit currently stands at 3,350 m (10,990 ft)
        above sea level, but varies according to the eruptions’ destruction or
        lava deposits. Because of the erratic nature of the eruptions, the
        approach to the central crater can vary from one eruption to the next
        (serious eruptions in 1998 lasted over a period of 8 months). Day
        excursions by bus and special Land Rover that connect with a cable car
        originate in Taormina or Catania. In any case, the last stretch to the
        crater itself is on foot, so take sturdy shoes and warm clothing — it’s
        cool and windy up there, even in the summer. From October to May, the
        summit is covered in snow and often closed to the public.
