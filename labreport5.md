__Lab Report 5__
---
One particular lab activity that I would like to revisit would be the exploration of the different ways in which you can use `find` and `grep`. In my 
own lab report 3, I explored 5 different way in which `grep` could be used, including commands such as `grep -v`, `grep "" file_name`, and `grep -c`.
For this report, I am going to explore 5 ways in which you can use the `find` command.

***Some of the terminal output is ommitted because of how long it is***

__First use:__  `find -iname` or searching by approximate name
